This readme explains how to generate the docs.

There are two scripts you may need: doc_generate.py and doc_clean.py
- doc_generate.py
This script calls the generate_modules.py script to generate the documentation of the complete bigr-fastr package family. Before doing this all *.rst are removed with doc_clean.py.
After cleaning and creating the rst files, `make html` is called which generates the html output in ./_build/html.

- doc_clean.py
This script basically removes all *.rst files from this directory.
