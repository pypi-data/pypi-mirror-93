= Phoebe

Phoebe is a data gathering proxy for https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] toolkit. Its goal is to gather metrics from systems that don't provide their own native Prometheus export, and make them available for digestion by Prometheus.


== How to run an exporter

[source,shell]
....
$ pip install tft-phoebe
$ phoebe-openstack --config=<your config file> --export=<filepath or - for stdout>
....

Or, after checking out the sources:

[source,shell]
....
$ poetry install
$ poetry run phoebe-openstack --config=<your config file> --export=<filepath or - for stdout>
....
