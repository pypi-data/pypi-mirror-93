*pypyr*

>   pronounce how you like, but I generally say *piper* as in "piping
    down the valleys wild"

pypyr is a free & open-source task-runner that lets you define and run
sequential steps in a pipeline.

Like a turbo-charged shell script, but less finicky. Less annoying than
a makefile.

pypyr runs pipelines defined in yaml. A pipeline is pretty much anything
you want to automate with a sequence of steps.

Automate anything by combining commands, different scripts in different
languages & applications into one pipeline process.

You can run loops, conditionally execute steps based on conditions you
specify, wait for status changes before continuing, break on failure
conditions or swallow errors. Pretty useful for orchestrating continuous
integration, continuous deployment & devops operations.

pypyr gives you simple variable substitution & configuration file
management so you can read, merge and write configuration files to and
from yaml, json or just text.

## Installation

```console
$ pip install --upgrade pypyr
```

Tested against Python \>=3.6

Stuck with an older version of python? Want to run pypyr in an
environment that you don't control, like a CI server somewhere?

You can use the [official pypyr docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pypyr/pypyr/) as a drop-in replacement
for the pypyr executable.

```console
$ docker run pypyr/pypyr echo "Ceci n'est pas une pipe"
```

## Usage
### This is a pipeline
Example pipeline that runs a sequence of steps and takes an optional
custom cli input argument:

```yaml
# ./show-me-what-you-got.yaml
context_parser: pypyr.parser.keyvaluepairs
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: o hai!
  - name: pypyr.steps.cmd
    in:
      cmd: echo any cmd you like
  - name: pypyr.steps.shell
    in:
      cmd: echo ninja shell power | grep '^ninja.*r$' 
  - name: pypyr.steps.py
    in:
      py: print('any python you like')
  - name: pypyr.steps.cmd
    while:
      max: 3
    in:
      cmd: echo gimme a {whileCounter}
  - name: pypyr.steps.cmd
    foreach: [once, twice, thrice]
    in:
      cmd: echo say {i}
  - name: pypyr.steps.default
    in:
      defaults:
        sayBye: False
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    run: '{sayBye}'
    in:
      echoMe: k bye!
```

### This is how you run a pipeline
This is what happens when you run this pipeline:

```console
$ pypyr show-me-what-you-got
o hai!
any cmd you like
ninja shell power
any python you like
gimme a 1
gimme a 2
gimme a 3
say once
say twice
say thrice

$ pypyr show-me-what-you-got sayBye=true  
o hai!
any cmd you like
ninja shell power
any python you like
gimme a 1
gimme a 2
gimme a 3
say once
say twice
say thrice
k bye!
```
