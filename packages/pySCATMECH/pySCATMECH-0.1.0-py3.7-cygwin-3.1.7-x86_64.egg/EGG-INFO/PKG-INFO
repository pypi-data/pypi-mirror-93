Description: # pySCATMECH Package
        
        pySCATMECH is a Python interface to SCATMECH: Polarized Light Scattering C++
        Class Library.
        
        ## SCATMECH
        
        SCATMECH is an object-oriented C++ class library developed to
        distribute models for light scattering applications. Included in the
        library are models for diffuse surface scattering that predict the
        bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), codes for
        calculating scattering by isolated particles, and codes for
        reflection, transmission, and diffraction from gratings. Emphasis has
        been given to those diffuse scatter models that are physics-based and
        which predict the polarization properties of the scattered light. The
        library also includes a number of classes that are useful for working
        with polarized light or the optics of thin films. The library is
        designed to enable expansion of new models.

        ## pySCATMECH Modules
        
        PySCATMECH contains nine modules:
        
        * mueller - Tools for handling Mueller matrices, Stokes vectors, Jones matrices, and Jones vectors
        * model - Tools for handling the SCATMECH::Model class, which handles generic models
        * fresnel - Tools for handling optical functions, thin films, and reflection and transmission coefficients
        * brdf - Tools for handling bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models (SCATMECH::BRDF_Model)
        * local - Tools for handling differential scattering cross-section (DSC) models of local defects on surfaces (SCATMECH::Local_BRDF_Model)
        * rcw - Tools for handling rigorous couple wave (RCW) analysis of 1D periodic gratings (SCATMECH::RCW_Model)
        * crossrcw - Tools for handling RCW analysis of 2D periodic gratings (SCATMECH::CrossRCW_Model)
        * scatterer - Tools for handling free-space scattering functions (SCATMECH::FreeSpaceScatterer)
        * integrate - Tools for integrating BRDF or DSC models
