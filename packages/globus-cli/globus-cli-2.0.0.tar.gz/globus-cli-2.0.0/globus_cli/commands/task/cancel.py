Output depends on whether or not '--all' was provided, and of course on the
requested output format.

If '--all' is requested, output will contain all task IDs which were
cancelled. If, in addition to this, the output format is text, the results will
be streamed as tasks are cancelled. JSON output is buffered and printed all at
once, after all of the cancellations.

When '--all' is not passed, output is a simple success message indicating that
the task was cancelled, or an error.
