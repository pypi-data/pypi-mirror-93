  reply_text: 'Rate your `python` skill from 0 to 5.

    0 if you''ve never heard of it as a programming language.

    You''d be a 5 if you are an internationally recognized expert who regularly writes
    blog posts.

    You could also be a 5 if you have written a book about Python.

    Another example of a 5 would be someone who has been the lead developer on a production
    python app for more than 1000 users.

    You''d be a 3 if you have created a github or gitlab repository with some python
    code that you''ve written from scratch yourself.

    You''d also be a 3 if you have a reputation of 1000 or more on Stack Exchange.

    You''d also be a 3 if you''ve ever given a lightning talk about anything python-related.'
