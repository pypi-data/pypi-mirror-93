2,yes,"Rate your `python` skill from 0 to 5.
0 if you've never heard of it as a programming language.
You'd be a 5 if you are an internationally recognized expert who regularly writes blog posts.
You could also be a 5 if you have written a book about Python.
Another example of a 5 would be someone who has been the lead developer on a production python app for more than 1000 users.
You'd be a 3 if you have created a github or gitlab repository with some python code that you've written from scratch yourself.
You'd also be a 3 if you have a reputation of 1000 or more on Stack Exchange.
You'd also be a 3 if you've ever given a lightning talk about anything python-related.",
