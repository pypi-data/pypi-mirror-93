Description: # switchto
        
        switch between dev and prod environments from command line.
        
        # Installation
        
        `pip install switchto`
        
        # How it works
        
        It edits your hosts file locally on Windows, Linux and Mac.
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Add entry
        
        `switchto -s my.website.com dev:127.0.0.1 team:192.168.1.100 prod:`
        
        This will create 3 entries for your website domain, named "dev", "team" and "prod".
        An empty string indicates to remove the entry from the hosts file once you run switchto that rule.
        
        ## Switching from production to dev environment and back
        
        `switchto dev`
        
        Will add the following entry to your hosts:
        
        `127.0.0.1 my.website.com`
        
        Once you want to go back to production, you can:
        
        `switchto prod`
        
        ## Remove entries
        
        You cannot remove entires from the config file, you can however set the rule to an empty string:
        
        `switchto -s my.website.com team:`
        
        Note: settings are saved in .s2.json on HOME or HOMEPATH directory.
        
        ## Listing config
        
        `switchto -l`
        
        To list everything, or:
        
        `switchto -l regex`
        
        Which will list all rules matching that regex.
        
        ## CNAMEs
        
        Currently, switchto works only via hosts, which do not support redirecting domains to other domains, but only by IP address.
        You can create a rule with a target domain, but it will be resolved once you create the rule, and also you would have to pass "-y" to confirm this:
        
        `switchto -y -s my.website.com dev:my.website.local dev`
        
        Note the "dev" at the end, which specifies to make the switch instantly, rather than running "switchto dev" afterwards.
