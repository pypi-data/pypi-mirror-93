    A new interface has been created allowing deployers to run arbitrary
    playbooks which are defined within a deployment plan. This interface is
    being created to replace the existing Mistral interface, which is largely
    used for HCI and NFV use cases. The interface will now process playbooks
    when they're defined within a plan under the `playbook_parameters` key.

    Playbook entries can be defined with, and without the base path. If no base
    path is defined within the entry, the interface will fall back to the
    constant tripleo playbook path, `/usr/share/ansible/tripleo-playbooks`.
    Options fined within a playbook entry will be passed into the playbook at
    runtime using extra-vars.

    * Interface usage example

    .. code-block:: yaml

      playbook_parameters:
        sample-playbook-0.yaml:
          x: 1
          y: a
        /path/to/sample-playbook-1.yaml:
          x: a
          y: 1
