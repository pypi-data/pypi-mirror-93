features:
  - |
    `openstack overcloud node delete` now can take
    `--overcloud-ssh-port-timeout` to configure connection timeout
    for Ansible. While `--timeout` configures the command timeout as expected.
fixes:
  - |
    Ansible connection timeout used for config download and the deployment
    timeout now will be given proper values. It fixes `bug 1868063
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1868063>`__.
