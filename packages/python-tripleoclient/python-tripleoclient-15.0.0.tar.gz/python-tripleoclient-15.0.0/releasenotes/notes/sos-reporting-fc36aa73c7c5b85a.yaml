features:
  - ReportExecute has been moved to the V2 client version where it will now
    execute an ansible playbook when running all log collection tasks. This
    playbook will run `sosreport` and collect a log archive on the undercloud
    host.
deprecations:
  - The log collection process will no longer store logs within swift. All
    collected logs will be stored in the `--output` path as provided by the
    CLI switch, using a default of **/var/lib/tripleo/support**.
  - The following ReportExecute CLI switches no longer have any effect;
    `--container`, `--skip-container-delete`, `--timeout`, `--concurrency`,
    `--collect-only`, `--download-only`. These options have been retained
    to ensure we're not breaking legacy compatibility, however, they will
    be removed in a future release.
