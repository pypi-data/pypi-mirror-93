# Python FSEconomy Interface Library

This package provides a python interface to the FSEconomy datafeeds. Your own personal data key can be retrieved from
the [FSEconomy data feeds page](https://server.fseconomy.net/datafeeds.jsp).

It provides access to the following data:

* Retrieval of assignments for a list of ICAOs - can be filtered by size/pax/trip type.
* Get a list of planes by type - can be filtered by hours since 100hr service/rentable

To avoid too many calls to the data feed the library will cache the plane data internally. This cache can be requested
to update if required.

## Examples

### Job Finder

This script will search for the highest paying jobs both in terms of v$ per nautical miles and overall value for a 
selected aircraft - filtered based on maximum distance and overall distance.

Usage example:

`python examples/job_finder.py --access-key=<personal FSE data feed key>`
