The est library goal is to provide some usefull process for acquisition/reconstruction automation.

est is distributed under the MIT license.

est is using the Qt library. A word of caution is to be provided. If users develop and distribute software using modules accessing Qt by means of Riverbank Computing Qt bindings PyQt4 or PyQt5, those users will be conditioned by the license of their PyQt4/5 software (GPL or commercial). If the end user does not own a commercial license of PyQt4 or PyQt5 and wishes to be free of any distribution condition, (s)he should be able to use PySide because it uses the LGPL license.

It can also be used as an Orange3 add-on. If you wan't to distribute Orange you must stick to there license (GNU [GPL-3.0]+ license)
