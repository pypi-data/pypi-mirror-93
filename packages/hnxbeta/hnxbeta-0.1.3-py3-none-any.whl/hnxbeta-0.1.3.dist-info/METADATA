Hnxbeta is a development version of HyperNetX 
intended for super users to test and give feedback. 
Please install in a virtual environment and send comments and bug reports to
hypernetx@pnnl.gov

The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for complex network data.
HyperNetX uses data structures designed to represent set systems containing
nested data and/or multi-way relationships. The library generalizes traditional
graph metrics to hypergraphs.

Hnxbeta has C++ support available from the NWHypergraph library. 
This library is still in development and will be updated frequently on PyPI.
At present it is only available for OSX and Centos7.
Mac users will need to `brew install tbb` and upgrade their gcc to 10.2.0
This can be done with `brew install gcc@10`  or `brew upgrade gcc`
To install NWHypergraph: `pip install nwhy`
