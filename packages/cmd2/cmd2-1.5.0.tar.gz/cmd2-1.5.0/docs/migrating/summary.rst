If you're thinking of migrating your cmd_ app to ``cmd2``, this section
will help you decide if it's right for your app, and show you how to
do it.

* :ref:`migrating/why:Why cmd2` - we try and convince you
  to use ``cmd2`` instead of cmd_
* :ref:`migrating/incompatibilities:Incompatibilities` - ``cmd2`` is not
  quite 100% compatible with cmd_.
* :ref:`migrating/minimum:Minimum Required Changes` - the minimum changes
  required to move from cmd_ to ``cmd2``. Start your migration here.
* :ref:`migrating/next_steps:Next Steps` - Once you've migrated, here a list
  of things you can do next to add even more functionality to your app.
