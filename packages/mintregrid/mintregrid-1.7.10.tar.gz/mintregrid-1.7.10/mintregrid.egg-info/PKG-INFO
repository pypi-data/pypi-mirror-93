Description: 
        Interpolates or regrids an edge centred field from a source grid to either a destination grid or a target element. The 
        interpolation is mimetic in the sense that line integrals are conserved from source to destination grids, i.e. Stokes'
        theorem is statisfied to near machine precision.
