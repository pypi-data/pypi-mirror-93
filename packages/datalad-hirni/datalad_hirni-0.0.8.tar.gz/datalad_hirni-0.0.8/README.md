This extension enhances DataLad (http://datalad.org) with support for
(semi-)automated, reproducible processing of (medical/neuro)imaging data.
Please see the [extension documentation](http://datalad-hirni.rtfd.org) for a
description on additional commands and functionality.

For general information on how to use or contribute to DataLad (and this
extension), please see the [DataLad website](http://datalad.org) or the
[main GitHub project page](http://datalad.org).


## Installation

Before you install this package, please make sure that you [install a recent
version of git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install).  Afterwards,
install the latest version of `datalad-hirni` from
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/datalad-hirni). It is recommended to use
a dedicated [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io):

    # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
    virtualenv --system-site-packages --python=python3 ~/env/datalad
    . ~/env/datalad/bin/activate

    # install from PyPi
    pip install datalad_hirni

    # alternative: install the latest development version from GitHub
    pip install git+https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/datalad-hirni.git#egg=datalad_hirni

## Support

The documentation of this project is found here:

If you have a problem or would like to ask a question about how to use DataLad,
please [submit a question to
NeuroStars.org](https://neurostars.org/tags/datalad) with a ``datalad`` tag.
NeuroStars.org is a platform similar to StackOverflow but dedicated to
neuroinformatics.
