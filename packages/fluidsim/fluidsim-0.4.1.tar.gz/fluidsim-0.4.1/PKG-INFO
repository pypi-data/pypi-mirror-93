        Fluidsim is an extensible framework for studying fluid dynamics with numerical
        simulations using Python. Fluidsim is an object-oriented library to develop
        solvers (mainly using pseudo-spectral methods) by writing mainly Python code.
        The result is **very efficient** even compared to a pure Fortran or C++ code
        since the time-consuming tasks are performed by optimized compiled functions.

        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        To try fluidsim without installation: |binder|
        
        For a **basic installation** it should be sufficient to run::
        
          pip install fluidsim
        
        Much more detailed instructions are given in `the documentation
        <https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__.
        
        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        Fluidsim is a `HPC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing>`_
        code. It is part of the wider project `FluidDyn
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluiddyn/>`_ and its pseudospectral solvers rely
        on the library `fluidfft <http://fluidfft.readthedocs.io>`_ to use very
        efficient FFT libraries. Fluidfft is written in C++, Cython and Python.
        Fluidfft and fluidsim take advantage of `Pythran
        <https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran>`_, an ahead-of-time compiler
        which produces very efficient binaries by compiling Python via C++11.
        
        An advantage of a CFD code written mostly in Python is that, to run simulations
        and analyze the results, the users communicate (possibly interactively)
        together and with the machine with Python, which is nowadays among the best
        languages to do these tasks. Moreover, it is much simpler and faster than with
        pure Fortran or C++ codes to add any complicated analysis or to write a
        modified solver. Fluidsim can also be used to extend existing solvers with
        Python interfaces such as `Basilisk <http://basilisk.fr>`__.
        
        We have created fluidsim to be **easy and nice to use and to develop**,
        **efficient** and **robust**.
        
        *Keywords and ambitions*: fluid dynamics research with Python (>=3.6);
        modular, object-oriented, collaborative, tested and documented, free and
        open-source software.
