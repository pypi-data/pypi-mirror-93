        The following package is the standalone wordlist-only component to 
        [flask-unsign](https://github.com/Paradoxis/Flask-Unsign). The two parts are separated to prevent you from having to also download the rather bulky wordlists if you only want to use the code.
        
        ## Installation
        To install the application, simply use pip:
        
        ```
        $ pip install flask-unsign-wordlist
        ```
        
        To install the tool for development purposes, run the following command (after downloading a copy):
        
        ```
        $ pip install -e .[test]
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use the wordlists, either download them directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/Paradoxis/Flask-Unsign-Wordlist/tree/master/flask_unsign_wordlist/wordlists) or install them with pip and either run the command line tool:
        
        ``` 
        $ flask-unsign-wordlist
        $ flask-unsign-wordlist <wordlist>
        ```
        
        Or import the code in Python to get the path:
        
        ```python
        import flask_unsign_wordlist
        print(flask_unsign_wordlist.get('all'))
        ```
