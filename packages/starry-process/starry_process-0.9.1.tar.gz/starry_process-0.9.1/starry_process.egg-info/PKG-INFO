        # A Gaussian Process for Stellar Variability
        
        The `starry_process` code implements an interpretable Gaussian process (GP)
        for modeling stellar light curves. Whether your goal is to marginalize
        over the stellar variability signal (if you think of it as noise)
        or to understand the surface features that generated it (if you
        think of it as data), this code is for you. The GP implemented here works
        just like any other GP you might already use in your analysis, except that
        its hyperparameters are *physically interpretable*. These are (among others)
        the **radius of the spots**, the
        **mean and variance of the latitude distribution**,
        the **spot contrast**, and the **number of spots**. Users can also specify
        things like the rotational period of the star, the limb darkening parameters,
        and the inclination (or marginalize over the inclination if it is not known).
        
        The code is written in Python and relies on the
        [Theano package](https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html),
        so a little familiarity with that is recommended. Check out the crash
        course [here](https://luger.dev/starry_process/notebooks/Quickstart.html#Compiling-theano-functions).
        
        # Quickstart
        
        Import the main interface:
        
        ```python
        from starry_process import StarryProcess
        ```
        
        Draw samples from a Gaussian process with small mid-latitude spots:
        
        ```python
        # Instantiate the GP
        sp = StarryProcess(
          r=10,               # spot radius in degrees
          mu=30,              # central spot latitude in degrees
          sigma=5,            # latitude std. dev. in degrees
          c=0.1,              # fractional spot contrast
          n=10                # number of spots
        )
        
        # Draw & visualize a spherical harmonic sample
        y = sp.draw_ylm().eval()
        sp.visualize(y)
        
        # Compute & plot the flux at some inclination
        t = np.linspace(0, 4, 1000)
        flux = sp.flux(y, t, i=60).eval()
        plt.plot(t, flux)
        ```

        Same as above, but for high-latitude spots:
        
        ```python
        sp = StarryProcess(r=10, mu=0, sigma=10, c=0.1, n=10)
        ```
        
        <img src="https://github.com/rodluger/starry_process/raw/gh-pages/_images/samples_1.png"/>
        
        Large equatorial spots:
        
        ```python
        sp = StarryProcess(r=30, mu=0, sigma=10, c=0.1, n=10)
        ```
        
        <img src="https://github.com/rodluger/starry_process/raw/gh-pages/_images/samples_2.png"/>
        
        Small, approximately isotropic spots:
        
        ```python
        sp = StarryProcess(r=10, mu=0, sigma=40, c=0.1, n=10)
        ```
