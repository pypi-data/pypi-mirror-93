    Constrain the angle of the Sun from the Earth limb.

    ----------
    min : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        Minimum angle of the edge of the sun's disc from the Earth's limb.

    Notes
    -----
    This constraint assumes a spherical Earth, so it is only accurate to about
    a degree for observers in very low Earth orbit (height of 100 km).
