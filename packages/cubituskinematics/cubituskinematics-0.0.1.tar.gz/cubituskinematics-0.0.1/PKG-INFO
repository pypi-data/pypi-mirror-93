Description: # Cubitus Kinematics Package
        
        This is the custom made package for Cubitus Robotic Arm. This package includes matplotlib plotting as well as realtime sending the data to the robotic manipulator itself.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following to install the package :
        
        ```console
        $ pip install cubituskinematics
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        First of all, you need to import cubituskinematics package/library into your project's python file.
        
        ```python
        import cubituskinematics as ck
        # or you could also use (but not recommended):
        from cubituskinematics import *
        ```
        
        Next you can test it using simple commands as shown below :
        
        ```python
        # declare two points (as a list)
        A = [200, 0, 120]
        B = [200, 0, 230]
        # performs a line movement
        ck.perform_line(A, B, sampling=50, repeat=1)
        # use 'sampling' and 'repeat' arguments to determine sampling and number of repetitions
        ```
        
        ```python
        # moves to one certain point in 3D space
        ck.move_to_point(210, 0, 170)
        ```

        ### User Interface Terminal
        
        If you want to use user interface use one simple command as shown below :
        ```python
        # opens user interface which acts like a simple command line terminal
        ck.run_ui()
        ```
        
        Here is a list of all possible commands which can be called via command line :
        
        ```console
        >> about       Show application info.
        >> clear       Clear terminal.
        >> exit        Exit interface.
        >> help        Show all commands.
        >> perform     Perform a specific movement based on input.
        >> equation    Perform a custom curve based on input.
        >> reset       Reset application.
        ```
