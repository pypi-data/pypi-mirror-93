Welcome to IDQuant's documentation!
===================================

**IDQuant (Isotopic Dilution Quantification) is a software that calculates sample concentrations
of metabolites from C12 and C13 Mass Spectrometry Integrated Data**

It uses linear and quadratic regression equations to predict concentrations using calibration data
from (unlabeled and fully labeled) Standard Molecules.
It takes as input integrated C12/C13 MS data from Emzed C13 Profiler.

It is one of the routine tools used by `MetaToul platform <https://www6.toulouse.inrae.fr/metatoul>`_.

The code is open-source, and available on GitHub under a GPLv3 license.
