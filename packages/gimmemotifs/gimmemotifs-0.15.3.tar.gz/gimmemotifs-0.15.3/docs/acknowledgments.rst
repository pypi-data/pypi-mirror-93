Acknowledgments
===============

We are grateful to Waseem Akhtar, Robert Akkers, Max Koeppel, Evelyn
Kouwenhoven, Marion Lohrum, Leonie Smeenk and Jo Zhou for providing data
and feedback during GimmeMotifs development. Also we would like to thank
Stefanie Bartels, Adalberto Costessi, Joost Martens and Nagesha Rao for
testing and helpful discussion. Of course GimmeMotifs by itself wouldn’t
be able to do anything, if there wasn’t such a number of excellent tools
available. Therefore, a big thanks to all the authors of the motif
prediction programs for making their software publicly available and
allowing me to distribute them with GimmeMotifs! In addition, I would
like to thank Wolfgang Lugmayr and Aaron Statham for various bugfixes.
