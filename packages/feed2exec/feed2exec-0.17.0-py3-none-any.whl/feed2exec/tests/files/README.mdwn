Test files for feed2exec
========================

Those files represent source RSS and Atom feeds (the `.xml` files) and
their rendered equivalent (the `.mbx` files) in [Mbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) format.

The format was chosen instead of the more efficient [Maildir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir)
format because we do not need to write those files on a regular basis
and reading a single mbox file at once is more efficient than a whole
Maildir folder, in our use case. Furthermore, it allows us to have a
single file reprensenting a feed instead of multiple files and folders
per feed.

To add a new test case, simply add the downloaded feed as a `.xml`
file. The test suite will pick it up and fail with some error
message. If the problem is a crash, fix the crash and rerun the test
suite until you get the mailbox to be generated. Once the mailbox is
generated or if the problem is malformed output, look for a path like
`/tmp/pytest-of-.*/pytest-\d+/Mail/.*.mbx` in the output and copy that
file into this directory, after making sure the output is
correct. Obviously, you will be testing for incorrect output, so you
will probably need to modify the output file.
