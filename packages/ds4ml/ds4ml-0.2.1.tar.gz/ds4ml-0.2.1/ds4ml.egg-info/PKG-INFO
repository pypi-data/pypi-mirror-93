Description: 
        The recent enforcement of data privacy protection regulations, such as GDPR,
        has made data sharing more difficult. This tool intends to facilitate data
        sharing from a customer by synthesizing a dataset based on the original dataset
        for later machine learning.
        
        There are two parts to this tool:
        
        - Data synthesizer
          Synthesize a dataset based on the original dataset. It accepts CSV data as
          input, and output a synthesized dataset based on Differential Privacy. The
          algorithm in the data synthesizer reference to the paper (
          http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/privbayes-tods.pdf).
        - Data utility evaluation
          Evaluate the data utility for the synthesized dataset. The original dataset
          and the synthesized dataset as the input, one utility evaluation report will
          be generated with several indicators.
