Description: # teamwork
        
        teamwork is a Python library designed to aid in the study of medical care team collaboration. 
        
        Specifically, the library takes EHR data as input and does the following: 
        1) identifies the members of medical care teams per patient visit
        2) builds a network graph for each care team based on their common patients in the previous 90 days
        
        The resulting care team network graphs can be used to compute the cumulative collaborative experience of care teams and other metrics.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install teamwork.
        
        ```bash
        pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ teamwork
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import teamwork
        import pandas as pd
        
        # read medical notes (3 columns) into pandas DataFrame
        notes_df = pd.read_csv("notes_file.csv", parse_dates=[2])
        # enforce column names
        notes_df.columns = ['discharge_id', 'dr', 'date']
        # set a 90 day window to find collaboration among care teams
        WINDOW = 90
        # identify care teams within 2 day increments 
        STEP = 2
        
        # the study runner is a generator
        get_care_dates = teamwork.TeamworkStudyRunner(notes_df, WINDOW, STEP)
        
        # gather care teams into a list
        care_team_list = [care_team for care_date in get_care_dates for care_team in care_date]
        
        # do something with the care team network graph
        for care_team in care_team_list:
            do_something(care_team.G)
        ```
