It is based on https://github.com/moygit/exact_cover_np by Moy Easwaran. Jack Grahl ported it to Python 3, fixed some bugs and made lots of small improvements to the packaging.\n\nThe original package by Moy was designed to solve sudoku. Now this package is only designed to solve exact cover problems given as boolean arrays. It can be used to solve sudoku and a variety of combinatorial problems. However the code to reduce a sudoku to an exact cover problem is no longer part of this project. It will be published separately in the future.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nThe exact cover problem is as follows: given a set X and a\ncollection S of subsets of X, we want to find a subcollection S*\nof S that is an exact cover or partition of X.  In other words,\nS* is a bunch of subsets of X whose union is X, and which have\nempty intersection with each other.  (Example below; more details [on\nwikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover).)\n\nThis NumPy module uses Donald Knuth\'s Algorithm X to find\nexact covers of sets.\nFor details on Algorithm X please see either\n[the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X)\nor [Knuth\'s paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1).\nSpecifically, we use the Knuth/Hitotsumatsu/Noshita method of\nDancing Links for efficient backtracking.  Please see\n[Knuth\'s paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1)\nfor details.\n\nAs an example, we use this NumPy module to\n[solve Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover#Sudoku).\nAs a bonus feature for the Sudoku piece, we also calculate an\napproximate rating of the puzzle (easy, medium, hard, or very hard).\n\n\nHow to Use It (Example)\n-----------------------\n\nSuppose X = {0,1,2,3,4}, and suppose S = {A,B,C,D}, where\n\n    A = {0, 3}\n    B = {0, 1, 2}\n    C = {1, 2}\n    D = {4}.\n\nHere we can just eyeball these sets and conclude that S* = {A,C,D} forms an\nexact cover: each element of X is in one of these sets (i.e. is\n"covered" by one of these sets), and no element of X is in more than\none.\n\nWe\'d use `exact_cover` to solve the problem as follows:\nusing 1 to denote that a particular member of X is in a subset and 0 to\ndenote that it\'s not, we can represent the sets as\n\n    A = 1,0,0,1,0    # The 0th and 3rd entries are 1 since 0 and 3 are in A; the rest are 0.\n    B = 1,1,1,0,0    # The 0th, 1st, and 2nd entries are 1, and the rest are 0,\n    C = 0,1,1,0,0    # etc.\n    D = 0,0,0,0,1\n\nNow we can call `exact_cover`:\n\n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> import exact_cover as ec\n    >>> S = np.array([[1,0,0,1,0],[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1]], dtype=\'int32\')\n    >>> ec.get_exact_cover(S)\n    array([0, 2, 3])\n\nThis is telling us that the 0th row (i.e. A), the 2nd row (i.e. C),\nand the 3rd row (i.e. D) together form an exact cover.\n\n\nImplementation Overview\n-----------------------\n\nThe NumPy module (`exact_cover`) is implemented in four pieces:\n\n- The lowest level is `quad_linked_list`, which implements a circular\n  linked-list with left-, right-, up-, and down-links.\n- This is used in `sparse_matrix` to implement the type of sparse\n  representation of matrices that Knuth describes in his paper (in\n  brief, each column contains all its non-zero entries, and each\n  non-zero cell also points to the (horizontally) next non-zero cell\n  in either direction).\n- Sparse matrices are used in `dlx` to implement Knuth\'s Dancing\n  Links version of his Algorithm X, which calculates exact covers.\n- `exact_cover` provides the glue code letting us invoke\n  `dlx` on NumPy arrays.\n\nRepository\n----------\n\n- build/ The location where files are built.\n- dist/ The location for fully prepared files.\n- exact_cover/ The build tool \'poetry\', seems to need this folder with a dummy python file so it doesn\'t worry about there not being any package.\n- obj/ Where the compiled C code is going to be output.\n- src/ The C sources.\n- tests/ Tests for both the Python package and the C code.\n- tools/ Code used in analysing and working with the library. This is not distributed with the package.\n\nAcknowledgement\n---------------\n\nThanks very much to Moy Easwaran (https://github.com/moygit) for his inspiring work!\n\n\n',
