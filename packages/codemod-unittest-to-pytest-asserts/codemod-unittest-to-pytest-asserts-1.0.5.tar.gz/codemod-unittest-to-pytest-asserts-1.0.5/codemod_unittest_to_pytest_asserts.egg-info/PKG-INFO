Description: **********************************
        codemod-unittest-to-pytest-asserts
        **********************************
        
        A `codemod <https://pypi.org/project/codemod/>`_ to automatically refactor
        unittest assertions with pytest assertions.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        This codemod requires Python 3.8 or newer.
        
        With pip, assuming Python 3.8 or newer is used::
        
           python3 -m pip install codemod-unittest-to-pytest-asserts
        
        With pipx, assuming Python 3.8 exists on the system::
        
           pipx install --python $(which python3.8) codemod-unittest-to-pytest-asserts
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Run the installed command on the Python files or directory of files you want to refactor::
        
           codemod-unittest-to-pytest-asserts some-python-files.py
        
        or::
        
           codemod-unittest-to-pytest-asserts some_directory/
        
        You'll be asked to confirm all changes.
        
        It is recommended to run an autoformatter, like Black, after the
        refactoring.
