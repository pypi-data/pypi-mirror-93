.. _bob.devtools.development:

===============================
 Local development of packages
===============================

Very often, developers are confronted with the need to
clone package repositories locally and develop installation/build and runtime code.
It is recommended to create isolated environments to develop new projects using conda_ and zc.buildout_.
Tools implemented in ``bob.devtools`` helps automate this process for |project| packages. In the following we talk about how to checkout and build one or several packages from their git_ source and build proper isolated environments to develop them. Then we will describe how to create a new bob package from scratch and develop existing bob packages along side it.

TLDR
====

Suppose you want to checkout the package ``bob.blitz`` from source and start developing it locally. We will use the tools implemented in ``bob.devtools`` to create a proper developing environment to build and develop ``bob.blitz``. We assume you have ``bob.devtools`` installed on a conda environment named ``bdt`` (Refer to :ref:`bob.devtools.install` for detailed information.)

* Checkout the source of the package from git:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ git clone https://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.blitz

* Create a proper conda environment:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd bob.blitz
   $ conda activate bdt
   $ bdt create -vv dev
   $ conda deactivate
   $ conda activate dev

* Build the package using buildout:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ buildout
   $ ./bin/python  # you should use this python to run things from now on

for example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import bob.blitz
    >>> bob.blitz # should print from '.../bob.blitz/bob/blitz/...'
    <module 'bob.blitz' from '.../bob.blitz/bob/blitz/__init__.py'>
    >>> print(bob.blitz.get_config())
    bob.blitz: 2.0.20b0 [api=0x0202] (.../bob.blitz)
    * C/C++ dependencies:
      - Blitz++: 0.10
      - Boost: 1.67.0
      - Compiler: {'name': 'gcc', 'version': '7.3.0'}
      - NumPy: {'abi': '0x01000009', 'api': '0x0000000D'}
      - Python: 3.6.9
    * Python dependencies:
      - bob.extension: 3.2.1b0 (.../envs/dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages)
      - click: 7.0 (.../envs/dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages)
      - click-plugins: 1.1.1 (.../envs/dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages)
      - numpy: 1.16.4 (.../envs/dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages)
      - setuptools: 41.0.1 (.../envs/dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages)

* You can optionally run the test suit to check your installation:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ./bin/nosetests -sv

.. note::

    Sometimes when you are calling a function not interactively it is not acting normally. In that case import ``pkg_resources`` before importing your package. It is a known issue and we are working on it.

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ ./bin/python -c "import pkg_resources; import bob.blitz; print(bob.blitz)"

* Some packages may come with a pre-commit_ config file (``.pre-commit-config.yaml``).
  Make sure to install pre-commit if the config file exists:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ # check if the configuration file exists:
   $ ls .pre-commit-config.yaml
   $ pip install pre-commit
   $ pre-commit install

.. bob.devtools.local_development:

Local development of existing packages
======================================
To develop existing |project| packages you need to checkout their source code and create a proper development environment using `buildout`.


Checking out package sources
----------------------------
|project| packages are developed through gitlab_. Various packages exist
in |project|'s gitlab_ instance. In the following we assume you want to install and build locally the ``bob.blitz`` package. In order to checkout a package, just use git_:


.. code-block:: sh

   $ git clone https://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.blitz


Create an isolated conda environment
------------------------------------

Now that we have the package checked out we need an isolated environment with proper configuration to develop the package. ``bob.devtools`` provides a tool that automatically creates such environment.
Before proceeding, you need to make sure that you already have a conda_ environment with ``bob.devtools`` installed in it (Refer to :ref:`bob.devtools.install` for more information). let's assume that you have a conda environment named ``bdt`` with installed ``bob.devtools``.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd bob.blitz
   $ conda activate bdt
   $ bdt create -vv dev
   $ conda deactivate
   $ conda activate dev


Now you have an isolated conda environment named `dev` with proper channels set. For more information about conda channels refer to `conda channel documentation`_.

The `bdt create` command assumes a directory named `conda`, exists on the current directory. The `conda` directory contains a file named `meta.yaml`, that is the recipe required to create a development environment for the package you want to develop.

.. note::

    When developing and testing new features, one often wishes to work against the very latest, *bleeding edge*, available set of changes on dependent packages.

    `bdt create` command adds `Bob beta channels`_ to highest priority which creates an environment with the latest dependencies instead of the latest *stable* versions of each package.

    If you want to create your environment using *stable* channels, you can use this command instead:

      .. code-block:: sh

        $ bdt create --stable -vv dev

    To see which channels you are using run:

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ conda config --get channels



.. note::

    We recommend creating a new conda_ environment for every project or task
    that you work on. This way you can have several isolated development
    environments which can be very different form each other.


Running buildout
----------------

The last step is to create a hooked-up environment so you can quickly test
local changes to your package w/o necessarily creating a conda-package.
zc.buildout_ takes care of it by modifying the load paths of scripts to find the correct
version of your package sources from the local checkout. It by default uses a file named `buildout.cfg`, in the package directory. For our example package it looks like:

.. code-block:: ini

  ; vim: set fileencoding=utf-8 :
  ; Mon 08 Aug 2016 14:33:54 CEST

  [buildout]
  parts = scripts
  develop = .
  eggs = bob.blitz
  extensions = bob.buildout
  newest = false
  verbose = true

  [scripts]
  recipe = bob.buildout:scripts

To find our more information about different section of this file, refer to :ref:`bob.devtools.buildout`.

Now you just need to run buildout:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd bob.blitz #if that is not the case
   $ conda activate dev #if that is not the case
   $ buildout



After running, buildout creates a directory called ``bin`` on your local package checkout. Use
the applications living there to develop your package. For example, if you need
to run the test suite:


.. code-block:: sh

   $ ./bin/nosetests -sv

or build the documentation:

.. code-block:: sh

    $./bin/sphinx-build -aEn doc sphinx  # make sure it finishes without warnings.
    $ firefox sphinx/index.html  # view the docs.

.. note::

    `buildout` by default uses the file `buildout.cfg` but you can specify another file by using -c option. In fact for developing packages especially if they need to be developed along with other packages, another file, namely `develop.cfg` is used like following:

    .. code-block:: sh

       $ buildout -c develop.cfg


A python interpreter clone can be used to run interactive sessions:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ./bin/python

You can see what is installed in your environment:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ conda list

And you can install new packages using conda:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ conda install <package>

.. note::

    If you want to debug a package regarding an issues showing on the ci you can use `bob.devtools`. Make sure the conda environment containing `bob.devtools` is activated.

    .. code-block:: sh

       $ cd <package>
       $ conda activate bdt
       $ bdt local build


One important advantage of using conda_ and zc.buildout_ is that it does
**not** require administrator privileges for setting up any of the above.
Furthermore, you will be able to create distributable environments for each
project you have. This is a great way to release code for laboratory exercises
or for a particular publication that depends on |project|.

Developing multiple existing packages simultaneously
----------------------------------------------------
It so happens that you want to develop several packages against each other for your project. Let's assume you want to develop ``bob.blitz`` and ``bob.extension`` simultaneously. ``bob.blitz`` is dependent on ``bob.devtools``. First we checkout package ``bob.blitz`` and build an isolated conda environment as explained in the previous section. Then edit `buildout.cfg` file (or `develop.cfg`) and add ``bob.extension`` to it as following:


.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    parts = scripts

    develop = src/bob.extension
              .

    eggs = bob.blitz

    extensions = bob.buildout
                 mr.developer

    auto-checkout = *


    ; options for bob.buildout extension
    debug = true
    verbose = true
    newest = false

    [sources]
    bob.extension = git https://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.extension

    [scripts]
    recipe = bob.buildout:scripts


Now you can run `buildout` as usual. The ``bob.extension`` will be checked out on `src` folder on the root of your project.

.. note::

  The flag `debug = true` is usually used when in development mode.


.. _bob.devtools.create_package:

Local development of a new package
==================================

In this section we explain how to create a new bob package from scratch and start developing it. Once again ``bob.devtools`` is here to help you. You need to activate your conda environment with ``bob.devtools`` installed in it.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ conda activate bdt
    $ bdt new -vv bob/bob.project.awesome author_name author_email

This command will create a new bob package named "bob.project.awesome" that includes the correct anatomy of a package. For more information about the functionality of each file check :ref:`bob.devtools.anatomy`.

In the root of your project there is a file `buildout.cfg` used by `buildout` to build your package locally. It should look like:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    parts = scripts
    develop = .
    eggs = bob.project.awesome
    extensions = bob.buildout
    newest = false
    verbose = true

    [scripts]
    recipe = bob.buildout:scripts
    dependent-scripts = true


Now you have all the necessary tools available and you can make a development environment using `bdt create` command, run `buildout` in it and start developing your package.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cd bob.project.awesome
    $ conda activate bdt
    $ bdt create --stable -vv awesome-project  #here we used the stable channels to make the conda environment.
    $ conda activate awesome-project
    $ buildout


Developing existing bob packages along with your new package
------------------------------------------------------------

Let's assume you need to develop two packages, ``bob.extension`` and ``bob.blitz``, as part of developing your new ``bob.project.awesome`` package.

You need to add these packages to the ``buildout.cfg`` file in the newly created folder.

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    parts = scripts

    develop = src/bob.extension
              src/bob.blitz
              .

    eggs = bob.extension
           bob.blitz
           bob.project.awesome

    extensions = bob.buildout
                 mr.developer

    auto-checkout = *
    newest = false
    verbose = true

    [scripts]
    recipe = bob.buildout:scripts
    dependent-scripts = true

    [sources]
    bob.extension = git https://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.extension
    bob.blitz = git https://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.blitz
    ; or
    ; bob.extension = git git@gitlab.idiap.ch:bob/bob.extension.git
    ; bob.blitz = git git@gitlab.idiap.ch:bob/bob.blitz.git


When you build your new package the dependent packages (in this example ``bob.extension`` and ``bob.blitz``) will be checked out on folder `src` in the root of your project.

As usual, first create an isolated conda environment using `bdt create` command. Some of bob packages need dependencies that might not be installed on your environment. You can find these dependencies by checking `conda/meta.yaml` of each package. Install the required packages and then run buildout as usual. For our example you need to do the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ conda install gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 libblitz
    $ buildout

.. note::

    Sometimes you may need some of bob packages available in your local `bin` directory without necessarily developing them.

    If you knew beforehand what are those packages, you can add them to "requirements/host" section of the `conda/meta.yaml` file and then create a conda environment using `bdt create`. Like this, those packages will be installed automatically. Otherwise, if you already have your conda environment, install them using `conda install` command.

    When done, add those packages to the `eggs` section in your `buildout.cfg` file and then run `buildout`.
