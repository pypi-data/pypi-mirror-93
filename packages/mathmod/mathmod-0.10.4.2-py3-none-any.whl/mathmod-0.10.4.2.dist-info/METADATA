# Mathmod
Have you ever looked for a complete, simple calculator module? Well here you go!

Mathmod has logarithm, fibonacci, arithmetic, tax, interest, and other calculators! It's the core of Palc. (Palc is an amazing calculator that strives to be simple while having many features.

Try it now - there are no fees, no risks, nothing! If you don't believe me, you can install from the source code manually. The code is available at https://github.com/thetechrobo/python-text-calculator/tree/master/mathmod.

Anyway, have a great day! Bye :D
