## NOTE: PALC DOES NOT WORK WITH PYTHON 2 AS OF NOW! IT IS JUST MATHMOD THAT WORKS. THIS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

## I cannot emphasize this enough: to contribute, READ [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) FIRST!!!!

Have you ever looked for a complete, simple calculator? Well here you go!

This is a Python script named "Palc" I forked when I wanted to learn math in Python. (UPDATE: And now that you can use it as a module it's even better!) There is almost no code left from the original (mainly because i've added and rewritten so much) but I'm still going to credit the original developer - see [lewiswatson55's repo](https://github.com/lewiswatson55/Python_Text_Calculator/) for the original code.

Learning this has been very interesting and educational. 

I always make my forked repositories better â€” and this one is no exception!  

Thanks for visiting!

# Recommended packages
It's suggested, if you're on Windows, to install `colorama` package (`pip install colorama`), to increase the chances of Palc working correctly. This module is unnecessary (but doesn't harm anything) for all other operating systems.
