`easyPyPI` (Pronounced "Easy Pie-Pea-Eye") is a quick, simple, one-size-fits-all solution for sharing your Python creations on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (**PyPI**) so others can just `pip install your_script` with no fuss.

`easyPyPI` is mainly intended for Pythonistas who've been put off publishing to **PyPI** before now or tried it but, like the author (pictured below) thought:

> "*There **must** be an easier way to do this!*"

Well now there is!  With `easyPyPI` you don't have to spend hours...

- Reading tutorials about `distutils` only to realise `setuptools` is what you need.
- Reading yet more tutorials just to work out the essential steps (below).
- Manually creating a folder structure and moving your script(s) there.
- Manually creating a skeleton `README.md`
- Manually creating a skeleton `__init__.py`
- Manually creating a skeleton `test_yourscript.py`
- Manually creating and updating a `LICENSE`
- Manually creating a `setup.py` script and wondering what on earth to put in it
- Remembering to update your Version number each time you publish
- Running `setup.py` in just the right way to create your distribution files
- Installing and running `twine` in just the right way to publish your package to **Test PyPI** then **PyPI**
- Creating a new Repository on Github and uploading the folders and files you just created.
- Setting environment variables or creating a `.pypirc` file for `twine`  to use
- Getting your **Test PyPI** and **PyPI** credentials mixed up

Enjoy!

# 1. QUICKSTART

    c:\> pip install easypypi

    >>> from easypypi import Package
    >>> package = Package()

    # or:
    >>> package = Package("your_package_name")

Then just follow the prompts to provide the information required to describe your package on **PyPI**.  No knowledge of `setuptools`, `twine`, or how to write a `setup.py` script required.

Once you've gone through the creation process fully (or even partially), your responses are stored in a JSON config file located in the 'usual' settings folder for your Operating System.  When you start again `easyPyPI` will helpfully remember your previous answers.

When you've added all the information you want to include with your package, click the `Upversion` button to update your [PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) compliant version number as required, then click the `Generate` button to create a basic folder structure and populate it with all the standard files you'll need such as a README and LICENSE.

The next time you run `easyPyPI` with an existing package name and folder location, it will automatically import the contents of the latest `setup.py` file it finds (in preference to `config.json`), so if you want you can make updates directly to `setup.py` but be careful to keep the same basic format so `easyPyPI` has a chance of finding what it needs!

Finally, when you're ready you can `Publish` your package folders and files to PyPI and/or Test PyPI, and even automatically create an initial Repository on Github.  There are buttons for quickly Registering for a PyPI, Test PyPI, and/or Github account if you don't already have that sorted, and also for installing Git if it's your first time using that too.

# 2. UPDATING YOUR PACKAGE

For more precise control you can close the GUI after creating your `package` object, and manually get and set all of the data encapsulated in it.  Thanks to the magic of [`cleverdict`](https://github.com/pfython/cleverdict) you can do this *either* using `object.attribute` or `dictionary['key']` notation, whichever you prefer:

    >>> package.name
    'as_easy_as_pie'

    >>> package['email'] = "new@name.com"

    >>> package['license_dict'].name
    'MIT License'

    >>> package.version = "2.0.1a1"

# 3. OTHER FEATURES

To find where `easyPyPI` and its default templates were installed:

    >>> package.easypypi_dirpath

To find the location of your JSON config file to manually inspect,  edit, or `os.remove()` it:

    >>> package.config_path
    # This should be under the default Settings folder for your Operating System.

To locate your package's `setup.py`:

    >>> package.setup_filepath

If you have extra files which you want to copy into the new folder structure, including the main script file you might have already created before deciding to make it into a package:

    >>> package.copy_other_files()

To see what else you can play with using your `Package` object:

    >>> package.keys()
    # You can then get/set values using object.attribute or dictionary['key'] notation

`esyPyPI` uses `keyring` to store credentials.  To manage these credentials manually:

    >>> account = "Github"  # or "PyPI" or "Test_PyPI"
    >>> package.Github_username = "testuser"

    >>> package.get_username(account) == package.Github_username == "testuser"
    True

    >>> package.set_password(account, "testpw")  # Prompts for pw if none given
    True

    >>> package.Github_password
    'testpw'

    >>> package.delete_credentials(account)

# 4. CONTRIBUTING
`easyPyPI` was developed in the author's spare time and is hopefully at a stage where it works well and reliably for the original use case.  If you'd like to get get involved please do log any Issues (bugs or feature requests) on Github, or if you feel motiviated to work on any of the existing Issues that would be brilliant!

If you're tinkering with the code and have just **Cloned** it, you'll probably need to be in the parent directory/parent under which you copied `easyPyPI` and use the following `import` incantation:

    >>> from easypypi.easypypi import *

If you excited enough by the potential of this package to contribute some code, please follow this simple process:

- **Fork** this repository. Also STAR this repository for bonus karma!
- Create a new **Branch** for the issue or feature you're working on.
- Create a separate `test_xyz.py` script to accompany any changes you make, and document your tests (and any new code) clearly enough that they'll tell us everything we need to know about your rationale and implementation approach.
- When you're ready and the new code passes all your tests, create a **Pull Request** from your **Branch** back to the **Main Branch** of this repository.

If you'd be kind enough to follow that approach it'll help speed things on their way and cause less brain-ache all round. Thank you, and we can't wait to hear people's ideas!

You can also get in contact on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/appawsom), and we're currently dabbling with the [CodeStream](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream) extension for VS Code which seems to have some helpful collaborative features, so perhaps we can connect with that too?
