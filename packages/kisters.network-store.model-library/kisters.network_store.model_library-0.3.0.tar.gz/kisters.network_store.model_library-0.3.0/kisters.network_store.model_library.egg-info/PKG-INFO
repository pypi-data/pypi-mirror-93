Description: # kisters.network_store.model_library
        
        Base models and associated utilities for the KISTERS Network Store.
        
        ## A Note on Entrypoints
        
        To publish a model library using entrypoints, add the domain and path to the
        root directory of your library to the entrypoint
        `kisters.network_store.model_library.util`. For example, the model library for
        the water domain looks as follows:
        
        ```python
        entry_points={
            "kisters.network_store.model_library.util": [
                "water = kisters.network_store.model_library.water"
            ],
        }
        ```
        
        For the entrypoint to correctly identify the models in the library, the root
        `__init__.py` must include the `links` and `nodes` modules. Furthermore, the
        parent node of your library's nodes is expected to be called `_Node` and the
        parent link is expected to be called `_Link`. All links and nodes in your
        library will inherit from these two elements.
