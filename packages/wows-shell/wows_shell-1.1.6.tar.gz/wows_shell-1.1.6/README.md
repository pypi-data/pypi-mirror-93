- C++ header only library for calculating shell performance in World of Warships
- Experimentally verified to be nearly identical to the World of Warships ballistics model

## Original Model Information & Source Code:
Original Model:
- [Code](https://pastebin.com/1NEwkf7R)
- [Post-Penetration Formulas](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfWarships/comments/560yg2/wows_ballistic_model_penetration) <br/>

Revised Model:
- [Code](https://pastebin.com/GXUt7BMJ)
## Features:
### Shell Flight
Computes shell flight path.
### At Impact:
Outputs:
  - Angle of Impact
  - Impact Velocity 
  - Raw, Belt/Deck, Normalization Adjusted Penetration 
  - Shell flight time (Real / In-game) <br/>

Ability to change trajectory computation method
  - Forward Euler (default - also in-game method) 
  - Runge-Kutta 2 and 4 
  - Adams-Bashforth 5
### Lateral Angles: 
Computes lateral angles where penetration, AP fuzing, and ricochets occur while adjusting for impact angle and vertical armor inclination. <br/>

Definition: Angles where that represent the horizontal angling of a ship:
  - Bow-in: 90 degrees 
  - Full-broadside: 0 degrees <br/>

Outputs:
  - Maximum Lateral Angle for Penetration 
  - Minimum Lateral Angle for Fusing 
  - Ricochet Lateral Angles <br/>

### Dispersion
Computes dispersion approximations based on experimental data. <br/>
Outputs:
  - Dispersion Types:
    - Horizontal Dispersion 
    - Vertical Dispersion
    - Area Dispersion
  - Statistical Types
    - Max Dispersion
    - Standard Deviation of Dispersion
    - 50% Error Radius

### Post-Penetration:
Shell detonation distance after penetration while adjusting for ship angling, and vertical armor inclinations. <br/>

Ability to modify the way the calculations are done 
- Enable or Disable Normalization changing direction
- Linear estimation or full air drag modeling
### Fitting:
Capability to fit shells to real world data using gradient descent. 
- Air Drag Coefficient
- Krupp
## Compatibility:
- Requires C++17 supporting compiler
- Supports multithreading and vectorization for improved performance
## Extensions:
### Python 
- Requires Pybind11
- Tested with Python 3.7.4 (Anaconda), 3.8.5
- Available from PyPI ```pip install wows-shell```
### WebAssembly 
- Requires Emscripten
- Used in https://github.com/jcw780/wows_ballistics
## Future Goals:
- Wiki / Tutorial
- Extend more features to Python and WebAssembly
- Will continue to update the model when new information is acquired
