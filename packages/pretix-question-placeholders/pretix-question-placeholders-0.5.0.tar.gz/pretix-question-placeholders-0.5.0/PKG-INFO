Description: Email content based on question answers
        =======================================
        
        This is a plugin for `pretix`_. 
        
        Add content to your emails based on the questions the customer answered, and
        the answer they gave.
        
        You can create multiple new placeholders, and can add several rules for each of
        them, with fallback texts for other answers or unanswered questions.
        
        Development setup
        -----------------
        
        1. Make sure that you have a working `pretix development setup`_.
        
        2. Clone this repository.
        
        3. Activate the virtual environment you use for pretix development.
        
        4. Execute ``python setup.py develop`` within this directory to register this application with pretix's plugin registry.
        
        5. Execute ``make`` within this directory to compile translations.
        
        6. Restart your local pretix server. You can now use the plugin from this repository for your events by enabling it in
           the 'plugins' tab in the settings.
        
        This plugin has CI set up to enforce a few code style rules. To check locally, you need these packages installed:
        
            pip install flake8 isort black docformatter
        
        To check your plugin for rule violations, run:
        
            docformatter --check -r .
            black --check .
            isort -c .
            flake8 .
        
        You can auto-fix some of these issues by running:
        
            docformatter -r .
            isort .
            black .
        
        To automatically check for these issues before you commit, you can run ``.install-hooks``.
