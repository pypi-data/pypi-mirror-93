# DevOps Tools 
This project consists on a collection of utility classes and modules in the context of DevOps and CICD


## Gitlab Wrapper

This class provides a wrapper for the Gitlab API and initially aims to help send outputs to project badges

## Pylint Wrapper

This class provides a wrapper for the Pylint quality report and initially aims to help send outputs to project badges

## Pypi Wrapper

This class provides a wrapper for common practices of building Pypi-compatible wheels.

## Release Notes:

Since atosdevopstools is intended to be publicly available under pypi to facilitate its usage on any other project and
regarless of the consortium setup, the source code here is obfuscated into a Cython package and distributed (**Will be distributed**)
for Windows and Ubuntu and which are named automatically using the format {distribution}-{version}(-{build tag})?-{python tag}-{abi tag}-{platform tag}.whl

E.g Local dev environment shows the following package being created: **atosdevopstools-1.0.1-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl**

Windows platform is yet to be automatically uploaded since CI environment can only produce linux wheels
This approach has some limitations and implies coding in a module-based way instead of a fully OOP approach. This is the reason
why **atosdevopstools does not contain a __init__.py file**. When installed from a different project, imports should point 
at the individual modules rather than at the atosdevopstools package:
```
pip install atosdevopstools  # The latest release for your Host will be downloaded and installed
```
```python
from gitlab_wrapper import GitlabWrapper
from pylint_wrapper import PylintWrapper
from pypi_wrapper import PyPiWrapper
```


### Changelog

1. v1.0.0: Basic functionalities extracted from demos of CICD pipelines with Gitlab
2. v1.0.1: Fix setup_badges and documentation updates
