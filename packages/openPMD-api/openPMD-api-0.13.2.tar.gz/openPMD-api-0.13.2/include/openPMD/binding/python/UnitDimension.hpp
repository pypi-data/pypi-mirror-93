Return the physical dimension (quantity) of a record

Annotating the physical dimension of a record allows us to read data
sets with arbitrary names and understand their purpose simply by
dimensional analysis. The dimensional base quantities in openPMD are
in order: length (L), mass (M), time (T), electric current (I),
thermodynamic temperature (theta), amount of substance (N),
luminous intensity (J) after the international system of quantities
(ISQ).

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities#Base_quantities
See https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-standard/blob/1.1.0/STANDARD.md#required-for-each-record

Returns the powers of the 7 base measures in the order specified above.
