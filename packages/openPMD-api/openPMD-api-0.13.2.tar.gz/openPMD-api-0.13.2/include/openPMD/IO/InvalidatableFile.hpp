     *  Wrapper around a shared pointer to:
     *  * a filename
     *  * and a boolean indicating whether the file still exists
     *  The wrapper adds no extra information, but some commodity functions.
     *  Invariant for any context within which this class shall be used:
     *  For any valid filename, there is at any time at most one
     *  such shared pointer (wrapper) known in said context's data structures
     *  (counting by pointer equality)
     *  This means, that a file can be invalidated (i.e. deleted or overwritten)
     *  by simply searching for one instance of the file among all known files and
     *  invalidating this instance
     *  A new instance may hence only be created after making sure that there are
     *  no valid instances in the data structures.
