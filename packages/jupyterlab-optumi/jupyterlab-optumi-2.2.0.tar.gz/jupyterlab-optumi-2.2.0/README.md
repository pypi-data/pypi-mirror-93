# **Welcome to Optumi ðŸ‘‹**

### Description

Optumi's JupyterLab extension provisions and manages ML environments in the cloud. Data scientists can seamlessly offload local notebooks as interactive sessions or batch jobs while software automatically cleans up infrastructure when no longer needed and makes it easy to keep track of spending.

Our goal is to help you spend more time developing models and less time on infrastructure.
