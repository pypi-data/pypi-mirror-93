Description: # pyperclip3
        
        Cross-platform clipboard utilities supporting both binary and text data.
        
        Some key features include:
        
        - A cross-platform API (supports MacOS, Windows, Linux)
        - Can handle arbitrary binary data
        - On Windows, some additional [clipboard formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dataxchg/standard-clipboard-formats) 
        are supported
        
        ## Installation
        
        Requires python 3.7+
        
        ```bash
        pip install pyperclip3
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        pyperclip3 can be used in Python code
        ```python
        import pyperclip3
        
        pyperclip3.copy("hello clipboard") # copy data to the clipboard
        cb_data = pyperclip3.paste() # retrieve clipboard contents 
        print(cb_data)
        
        pyperclip3.clear() # clears the clipboard contents
        assert not pyperclip3.paste()
        ```
        
        Or a CLI
        
        ```bash
        # paste clipboard contents to stdout
        python -m pyperclip3 paste
        
        # load contents to the clipboard from stdin
        python -m pyperclip3 copy < myfile.text
        # same as above, but pipe from another command
        some-program | python -m pyperclip3 copy
        ```
        
        ## Status
        
        This library will implement functionality for several platforms and clipboard utilities. 
        
        - [x] MacOS
        - [x] Windows
        - [ ] Linux (xclip - coming soon)
        - [ ] Linux (xsel - coming soon)

        ## Platform specific notes/issues
        
        ### Windows
        
        - On Windows, the `pywin32` package is required.
        - On Windows, additional clipboard formats are supported, including copying from a file 
        (like if you right-click copy from File Explorer)
        
        ### MacOS
        
        MacOS has support for multiple backends. By default, the `pasteboard` package is used.
        
        `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` can also be used as a backend, but does not support arbitrary binary data, which may lead to 
        data being lost on copy/paste. This backend may be removed in a future release.
        
        ### Linux
        
        Linux requires `xclip` or `xsel` to work. Install with your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install ...`
