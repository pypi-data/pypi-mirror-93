## Feedback Transformer - Pytorch (wip)

Simple implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09402">Feedback Transformer</a> in Pytorch. They improve on Transformer-XL by having each token have access to the representations of all previous layers through time. This is achieved by aggregating the outputs of all layers into a shared memory, which each token can attend to at each time step. The main drawback is longer training time, due to its non-parallel nature.

I'll also take the liberty to add some various enhancements, including pre-normalization, GLU gated feedforwards, as well as simplified T5 relative positional embeddings.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install feedback-transformer-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from feedback_transformer_pytorch import FeedbackTransformer

model = FeedbackTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,           # number of tokens
    dim = 512,                    # dimension
    depth = 6,                    # depth
    seq_len = 2,                  # the sequence length of each segment or window
    mem_len = 256,                # length of the memory buffer
    dim_head = 64,                # dimension of each head
    heads = 8,                    # number of heads
    attn_dropout = 0.1,           # attention dropout
    ff_dropout = 0.1              # feedforward dropout
).cuda()

x = torch.randint(0, 256, (2, 512)).cuda() # (1, 512, 20000)
```
