  abstract = {AIPS has been writing images and uv data in FITS-format files
              for a very long time. While these files have been used widely in
              the community, there is a perception that a detailed document is
              still required. This memo is an attempt to meet that perception.
              AIPS FITS files for uv are conventions layered upon the standard
              FITS format to assist in the interchange of data recorded by
              interferometric telescopes, particularly by radio telescopes such
              as the EVLA and VLBA.},
