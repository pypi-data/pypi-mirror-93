Description: # Aviso
        
        Aviso is a software developed by ECMWF that allows the notification of  **time-critical events** across HPC and Cloud systems in 
        order to enable workflows among multiple domains.
        
        It allows users to:
        
        * Define events that require notification
        * Define triggers to be executed once a notification is received
        * Send and receive notifications
        
        This enables the creation of automatic workflows, timely triggered as events are notified.
