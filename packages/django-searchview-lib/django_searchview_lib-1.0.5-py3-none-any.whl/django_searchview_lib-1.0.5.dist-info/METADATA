# django-searchview
SearchView is a multiple inheritance class of Form and ListView 

When I wanted to make a Search Page with class based View of Django, the first choice was using FormView and ListView.
But, I wanted to display search form and results list in one page.
I needed a new view class, multiple inheritance from FormView and ListView.
I searched for it, but I couldnâ€™t find a good solution. So I made it by myself.

see below.

Code is simple and less than 100 steps. But it's very useful.
