Introduction
---------------

BlazeUtils was originally developed as a library to hold common tools for the
`Blaze library family <https://github.com/blazelibs/>`_.

Over the years it has been expanded to be somewhat of a catch-all for tools commonly used by
the `Level 12 <https://level12.io/>`_ development team.
