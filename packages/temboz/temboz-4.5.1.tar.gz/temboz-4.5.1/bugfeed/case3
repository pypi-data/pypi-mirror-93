         <title>Structure 08: Our Web Infrastructure Conference</title>
         <link>http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/gigaomnimedia/~3/250370009/</link>
         <description>Web businesses -- From Google to Facebook to Hulu to MySpace, and everything in between — are seeing unprecedented growth, and the new web infrastructure buildout presents a huge opportunity, for both entrepreneurs and their backers. We will explore this buildout -- the ideas, the technology and the money behind it all -- at our Structure 08 conference on June 25.</description>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>These days, San Francisco&#8217;s skyline is not marked so much by the Transamerica Pyramid or Coit Tower as it is by cranes and the jagged outlines of half-finished buildings, symptoms of its struggle to meet the growing demand for housing and office space. The city by the Bay&#8217;s construction activity, however, only mirrors the frenzied buildout of the web’s infrastructure.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/08/"><img src="http://gigaom.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/structure_08_by_gigaom.jpg" alt="structure_08_by_gigaom.jpg"/></a>From Google to Facebook to Hulu to MySpace &#8212; web businesses are seeing unprecedented growth. In an effort to meet the demands of their customers, these companies have been forced to spend billions of dollars on servers, switches and a whole lot of other stuff that, taken together, forms an &#8220;infrastructure.&#8221; But such unprecedented growth is putting that infrastructure under extreme stress.</p> <p>A parallel to this buildout took place in the mid-1990s, when the emergence of the Internet economy resulted in booming demand for bandwidth, connectivity and other such services. That led to an unprecedented spending cycle, with telecoms sinking billions of dollars into new technologies that helped spawn startups such as Ciena and Juniper Networks.</p> <p>The new web infrastructure buildout presents a similar opportunity, both for entrepreneurs and their backers. As I <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2007/12/07/reader-feedback-required-the-infrastructure-theories/">noted not too long ago</a>, we are in a period of flux: The platforms on which we have done business for over a decade are starting to provide diminishing returns; the smart money, meanwhile, is seeking new platform structures.</p> <p>We&#8217;ve already started to see some cool new ideas. We plan to explore these ideas, and their manifestations &#8212; which range from new databases to new architectures for data centers &#8212; at our first GigaOM conference, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/08/">Structure 08.</a></p> <p>Structure 08 will gather the most innovative and influential industry leaders together to explore the latest Internet infrastructure buildout. It will sort through the emerging and disruptive computing technologies and inform businesses on how best to leverage them. And it will provide insight to investors and executives on the best implementations, ideas and startups out there today &#8212; and what to look for tomorrow.</p> <p>The conference will take place on June 25th at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/08/venue/">the Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco</a>. Among our scheduled <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/08/speakers/">keynote speakers</a> are Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon.com, and Greg Papadopoulos, CTO of Sun Microsystems. Other speakers include VMware co-founder Mendel Rosenblum and Salesforce.com founder Parker Harris.</p> <p>I am working with Surj Patel and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/08/advisors/">our stellar program committee</a> on this conference. We are still in the process of finalizing the line-up, panels and speakers so in the meantime, your suggestions are more than welcome. Please <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/08/speakers/#speaker_nominations">drop me a line with speaker nominations</a> and panel suggestions. If you would like to buy <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://structure08-GOM312.eventbrite.com">early-bird tickets, please visit the conference web site.</a></p> <p>Hope to see you on June 25th.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>I have spent the past two months recuperating from my medical setback – reading, rebuilding my physical strength and of course, writing an occasional blog post or two. My doctors have given me permission to work &#8212; four hours a day – though travels and excessive appointments everyday are still a no-go. Nevertheless, it does feel good to resume some sort of normalcy. As part of my return, I would like to introduce to you the newest member of the GigaOM network: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://ostatic.com/">OStatic</a>. It is a blog devoted to open-source software, notably the business of it (and the name is a play on “Ecstatic about Open Source”).</p> <p>Why open source? And why now? I think the answer to both questions lies with recent events in the software industry: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.news.com/2100-7344_3-6059293.html">RedHat Software snapping up JBoss</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://gigaom.com/2008/01/16/sun-buys-mysql-for-1b-and-wall-street-mourns/">Sun Microsystems’ billion-dollar buyout of MySQL</a> and Microsoft’s decision to open up. All are part of a larger trend that has transformed open source from little more than a curiosity into a legitimate and viable part of the business ecosystem.</p> <p>The open-source movement is ready to revolutionize the mobile phone industry; even traditional telecom is starting to see its potential. Asterisk, for instance, has become a source of innovation, and has helped spawn companies like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://gigaom.com/2007/01/01/truphone/">Truphone</a>. And <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://gigaom.com/2006/08/09/digium-asteisk/">venture dollars have started to flow</a> into open-source startups at an increasingly rapid clip. Open source is slowly but surely touching (and changing) our daily lives.</p> <p>For this new venture, we have deviated a little bit from our traditional blog model – we are adding a directory that lists about 150,000 software listings. The listings link to either projects, their original home pages, or SourceForge. The new blog also has a “Q&amp;A” section that will allow you to ask questions and get answers from the community. The technology and a lot of the initial content for the site has come via a licensing agreement with Cambridge, Mass.-based <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://voxholdings.com/">VOX Holdings</a>.</p> <p>I hope you will give the new blog a fair shake and add it to your RSS reader. (You can do that by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://ostatic.com/blog/feed/">clicking and subscribing to the OStatic feed</a>.) If you are a subscriber to the GigaOM Network feed then you will see OStatic posts show up in your feed reader automatically.</p> <p>With this out of the way, and me back on track (partially), it’s time to start working on the next blog. Ah…the stress of deadlines.</p> <p>Update:</p> <ul>
