.. [#] Warning!!!  Any program can come under attack, and probably will. By default, every process runs with the privileges of the user or process that started it. Therefore, if a user has logged on with restricted privileges, your program should run with those restricted privileges. This effectively limits the amount of damage an attacker can do, even if he successfully hijacks your program into running malicious code. Do not assume that the user is logged in with administrator privileges; you should be prepared to run a helper application with elevated privileges if you need them to accomplish a task. However, keep in mind that, if you elevate your processâ€™s privileges to run as root, an attacker can gain those elevated privileges and potentially take over control of the whole system.
