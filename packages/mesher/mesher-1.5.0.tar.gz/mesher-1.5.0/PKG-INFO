Description: 
              Mesher is a novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software that allows mesh generation to be generated from an arbitrary number of hydrologically important features while maintaining a variable spatial resolution. 
              Triangle quality is guaranteed as well as a smooth graduation from small to large triangles. Including these additional features resulted in a better representation of spatial heterogeneity versus classic topography-only mesh generation.

                Key points
                
                *  A novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software, Mesher
                *  Heterogeneity in topography is resolved as well as hydrologically important surface and sub-surface attributes
                *  Spatial heterogeneity is better preserved compared to existing mesh generators
