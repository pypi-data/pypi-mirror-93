Mesher is a novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software that allows mesh generation to be generated from an arbitrary number of hydrologically important features while maintaining a variable spatial resolution. 
Triangle quality is guaranteed as well as a smooth graduation from small to large triangles. Including these additional features resulted in a better representation of spatial heterogeneity versus classic topography-only mesh generation.

  Key points

  *  A novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software, Mesher
  *  Heterogeneity in topography is resolved as well as hydrologically important surface and sub-surface attributes
  *  Spatial heterogeneity is better preserved compared to existing mesh generators
