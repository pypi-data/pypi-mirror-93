label = "glycine7 - calculate homology and synteny for 7 Glycine genomes"
notes = """
This script uses 7 glycine genomes from the Legume Federation Data Store.
Genome data are downloaded on-the-fly.  The tricky part of this setup is
that there are four distinct phylogenetic levels represented.

1. genus Glycines
2. species Glycine max and Glycine soja
3. three strains of Glycine max, two strains of Glycine soja
4. three different annotations of Glycine max strain 'Williams 82'

To run this example execute the script "do_glycine7.sh".
On a modern 12-core workstation, this examples takes about 10 minutes
including downloads.  Most of the time is spent calculating homology.
