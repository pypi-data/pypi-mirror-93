prelude: >
    Queens test templates are now available, while Newton
    test templates have been removed.
features:
  - A folder with scenario templates for Queens was added.
    It is a subset of the templates in the main directory.
  - The available templates now supports Spark 2.2
    and Vanilla 2.8.2.
deprecations:
  - The Newton-specific job templates have been removed.
    This means that starting from this release Newton is
    not supported (it has been EOL for a while).
