    Fixes and addition for the API and CLI tests.

    Support for CDH 5.9 in scenario tests.

    Less parameters required for scenario tests.
features:
  - The Tempest-based tests have received an increase of the coverage
    for both API and CLI tests (job, plugins, templates; negative
    testing).
  - CDH 5.9 can be tested thanks to the addition of the specific
    templates.
  - Few parameters are not required anymore by the templates in scenario
    tests; a default value is provided (name of templates, etc).
  - The flavors used in templates are now parameters too.
  - If a flavor name is provided in addition to its specification and
    a flavor with that name exists, it is used and not created again.
  - The dependencies on non-public Tempest interfaces have been
    removed.
upgrade:
  - the name of the variables/parameters used for the name of
    the images in the scenario tests have been changes to follow
    a more consistent pattern.
critical:
  - The Tempest plugin was fixed after the removal of
    the data_processing plugin from the tempest repository.
    Most of the work was in place, only a small change was
    missing.
fixes:
  - The artifacts created during the execution of CLI tests
    are properly cleaned at the end of the tests.
other:
  - The documentation was improved (scenario tests) and
    extended (Tempest plugin).
