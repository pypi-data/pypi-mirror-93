features:
  - A folder with scenario templates for Rocky was added.
    It is a subset of the templates in the main directory,
    and includes all non-deprecated plugin/versions.

    Spark 2.3, Storm 1.2, Vanilla 2.7.5, and the Ambari-based
    HDP 2.6 and 2.5.
fixes:
  - The CDH 5.11 test template, previously only available for queens,
    was added to main (unversioned) templates directory.
upgrades:
  - All the templates for deprecated version/plugins were removed
    from the main (unversioned) templates directory.
