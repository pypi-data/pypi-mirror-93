    Client tests have been imported from the Sahara repository.
features:
  - The tests for the official Python clients have been moved here
    from the Sahara repository. They are based on the Tempest
    libraries even they do not follow the Tempest guidelines
    (as they need to test the Python clients, they do not use
    the native Tempest clients).
