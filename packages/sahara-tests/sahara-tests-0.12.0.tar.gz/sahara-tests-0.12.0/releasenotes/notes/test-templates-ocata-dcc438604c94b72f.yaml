prelude: >
    Ocata test templates are now available, while Liberty
    test templates have been removed.
features:
  - A folder with test templates with Ocata has been created
    and initialized starting from the templates in the main
    directory, following the status of the jobs tested on
    the Sahara CI.
deprecations:
  - The Liberty-specific job templates have been removed.
    This means that starting from this release Liberty is
    not supported (it has been EOL for a while).
  - The MapR 5.0.0 test template have been removed from
    the master branch as well.
