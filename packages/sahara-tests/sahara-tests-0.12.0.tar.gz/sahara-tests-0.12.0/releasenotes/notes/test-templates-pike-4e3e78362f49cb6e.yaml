prelude: >
    Pike test templates are now available, while Mitaka
    test templates have been removed.
features:
  - A folder with scenario templates for Pike was added.
    It is a subset of the templates in the main directory.
  - Some requirements have been raised (especially Tempest).
deprecations:
  - The Mitaka-specific job templates have been removed.
    This means that starting from this release Mitaka is
    not supported (it has been EOL for a while).
