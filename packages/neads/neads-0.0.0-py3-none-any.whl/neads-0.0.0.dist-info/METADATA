Neads
=====

NEADS is a modular tool to process comparative studies on dynamical systems
with an inherent network structure. It enables a simple design of 
analytical pipelines via a plugin architecture. Using this approach, we 
can use this tool for explorative and comparative studies on dynamical 
systems. This tool also implements procedures from essential tools such as 
Numpy or NetworkX, making plugin design easier. This tool is suitable for 
many real-world systems including the human brain, financial systems or 
social networks, see `examples <https://www.cs.cas
.cz/hartman/neads/doc/html/examples/index.html>`_ in documentation.
