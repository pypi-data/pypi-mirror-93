Description: Neads
        =====
        
        NEADS is a modular tool to process comparative studies on dynamical systems
        with an inherent network structure. It enables a simple design of 
        analytical pipelines via a plugin architecture. Using this approach, we 
        can use this tool for explorative and comparative studies on dynamical 
        systems. This tool also implements procedures from essential tools such as 
        Numpy or NetworkX, making plugin design easier. This tool is suitable for 
        many real-world systems including the human brain, financial systems or 
        social networks, see `examples <https://www.cs.cas
        .cz/hartman/neads/doc/html/examples/index.html>`_ in documentation.
