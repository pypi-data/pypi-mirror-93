Description: # ACQ4-Autopatch
        Automated cell patching extension for ACQ4
        
        # Installation
        
        Install the package into your environment with e.g.
        
        ```sh
        pip install acq4_autopatch
        ```
        or
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/sensapex/acq4-autopatch.git
        conda develop acq4-autopatch
        ```
        
        Customize the following to suit your hardware and add it to the `modules:` section of your ACQ4 `default.cfg`
        file:
        
        ```yaml
            Autopatch:
                module: 'acq4_autopatch.module.AutopatchModule'
                config:
                    imagingDevice: 'Camera'
                    patchDevices:
                        PatchPipette1: (0, 0)  # bottom-left quad
                        PatchPipette2: (50*mm, 0)  # bottom-right quad
                        PatchPipette3: (0, 50*mm)  # top-left quad
                        PatchPipette4: (50*mm, 50*mm)  # top-right quad
                    plateCenter: (0, 0, 0)
                    wellPositions: [(0, 0), (50*mm, 0), (0, 50*mm), (50*mm, 50*mm)]
                    patchStates:
                        cell detect:
                            maxAdvanceDistancePastTarget: 1*um
                        seal:
                            autoSealTimeout: 60
                            pressureMode: 'auto'
                        cell attached:
                            autoBreakInDelay: 5.0
                        clean:
                            approachHeight: 3*mm
                            cleanSequence: [(-35e3, 1.0), (65e3, 1.5)] * 5
                            rinseSequence: [(-35e3, 3.0), (65e3, 15.0)]
                    cameraChannels:
                        # Use different (exposure, trigger) DAQ lines for each pipette device
                        PatchPipette1: ('/Dev1/port0/line0', '/Dev1/port0/line1')
                        PatchPipette2: ('/Dev2/port0/line0', '/Dev2/port0/line1')
                        PatchPipette3: ('/Dev3/port0/line0', '/Dev3/port0/line1')
                        PatchPipette4: ('/Dev4/port0/line0', '/Dev4/port0/line1')
        
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        Briefly:
        1. Make sure you have an active Storage directory in the DataManager module.
        1. Open the Camera module.
           1. The first time through, use this to move each pipette into its home, clean and rinse positions.
           1. In the main ACQ4 Manager window, save the home on each Manipulator.
           1. In the main ACQ4 Manager window, save the clean and rinse on each PatchPipette.
           1. Do any other calibration necessary.
        1. For each pipette, open a separate TaskRunner module.
           1. Enable the Clamp associated with this pipette.
           1. Configure the tasks to be performed after a cell is patched.
        1. Open the MultiPatch module. This is useful for monitoring.
        1. Open the Autopatch module.
           1. Press "Add Points" and add one in the Camera for every cell you'd like to patch. Repeat for each well.
           1. Pick your acquisition protocol.
           1. Press "Start"
        1. Monitor status in the "Pipettes" pane or in the MultiPatch window.
        1. Read through results or look at errors in the "Results" pane.
        
        TODO create and then link to video explanation.
