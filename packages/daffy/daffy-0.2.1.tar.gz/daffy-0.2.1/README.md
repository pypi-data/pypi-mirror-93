# DAFFY DataFrame Column Validator
![test](https://github.com/fourkind/daffy/workflows/test/badge.svg)

## Description 

In projects using Pandas, it's very common to have functions that take Pandas DataFrames as input or produce them as output.
It's hard to figure out quickly what these DataFrames contain. This library offers simple decorators to annotate your functions
so that they document themselves and that documentation is kept up-to-date by validating the input and output on runtime.

## Installation

Install with your favorite Python dependency manager like

```sh
pip install daffy
```

or

```sh
poetry add daffy
```


## Usage 

Start by importing the needed decorators:

```
from daffy import df_in, df_out
```

To check a DataFrame input to a function, annotate the function with `@df_in`. For example the following function expects to get
a DataFrame with columns `Brand` and `Price`:

```python
@df_in(columns=["Brand", "Price"])
def process_cars(car_df):
    # do stuff with cars
```

If your function takes multiple arguments, specify the field to be checked with it's `name`:

```python
@df_in(name="car_df", columns=["Brand", "Price"])
def process_cars(year, style, car_df):
    # do stuff with cars
```

To check that a function returns a DataFrame with specific columns, use `@df_out` decorator:

```python
@df_out(columns=["Brand", "Price"])
def get_all_cars():
    # get those cars
    return all_cars_df
```

To check both input and output, just use both annotations on the same function:

```python
@df_in(columns=["Brand", "Price"])
@df_out(columns=["Brand", "Price"])
def filter_cars(car_df):
    # filter some cars
    return filtered_cars_df
```

If you want to also check the data types of each column, you can replace the column array:

```python
columns=["Brand", "Price"]
```

with a dict:

```python
columns={"Brand": "object", "Price": "int64"}
```

This will not only check that the specified columns are found from the DataFrame but also that their `dtype` is the expected.
