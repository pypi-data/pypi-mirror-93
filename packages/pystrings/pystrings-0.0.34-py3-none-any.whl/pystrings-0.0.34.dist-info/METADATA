# pystrings
### For ease of working with strings
If you, like me, have an obsession with writing strings, use pystrings

Write it once, then call it

You can use pystrings as below:
```
from pystrings import create_strings

#initialization 
my_str = create_strings(['hell_world', 'use_it_for_handle_all_strings', 'haha'])

#example for test it 
print(my_str.haha) 
==>haha 
```
pystrings is an **open-source** library

you can use it in all source code instead strings, like use in instead of ML hyperparameters 

just you must inshialize pystrings with your strings and call it later 

In the **Jupyter** web application this is a great function, when you select a cell for initialization and whenever you need to add a string, you update this cell and run it again.


We have good news in the next updates
