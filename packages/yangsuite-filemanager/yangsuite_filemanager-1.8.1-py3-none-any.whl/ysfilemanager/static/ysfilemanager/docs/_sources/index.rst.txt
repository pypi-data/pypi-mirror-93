Managing YANG module files in YANG Suite
========================================

In YANG Suite, a **"YANG repository"** is a self-contained collection of
related YANG models.
In general you might have one repository for each Cisco OS release,
one repository per class of routers or switches,
or whatever other organizational method you find most convenient.

Each YANG repository will have one or more associated YANG model sets.
A **"YANG set"** is a subset of a YANG repository, consisting of a set of
modules of interest and any necessary dependencies they have.

A YANG set could be as large as the entire repository's contents,
but it's often more efficient to narrow the set down to only the models that
you're really interested in for a given application. For example, you might
have a YANG repository of all models supported by the Cisco CSR 1000V platform
running IOS XE 16.9.1, then have a YANG set for the models in this repository
that apply to BGP configuration and state, another YANG set (which may overlap
with the other set) for the models that apply to interface configuration and
state, a third YANG set containing only supported OpenConfig models, etc.

For more information on how to create and manage both repositories and sets,
