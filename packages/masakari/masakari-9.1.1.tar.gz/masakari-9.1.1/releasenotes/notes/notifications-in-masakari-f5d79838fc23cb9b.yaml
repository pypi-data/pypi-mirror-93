    Added support to emit event notifications whenever user interacts with
    Masakari restFul APIs. The emitted notifications are documented at
    `sample_payloads`_.

    To enable this feature one should set `driver` config option under the
    `oslo_messaging_notifications` section as shown below::

      [oslo_messaging_notifications]
      driver = log

    Note: Possible values are `messaging`, `messagingv2`, `routing`, `log`,
    `test`, `noop`.
    Notifications can be completely disabled by setting `driver` value as `noop`
