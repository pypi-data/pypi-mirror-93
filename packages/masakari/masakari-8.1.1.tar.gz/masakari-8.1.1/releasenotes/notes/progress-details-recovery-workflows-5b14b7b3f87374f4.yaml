    Added support to record the recovery workflow details of the notification
    which will be returned in a new microversion 1.1 in
    `GET /notifications/{notification_id}` API.

    For example, GET /notifications/<notification_uuid> response will contain
    `recovery_workflow_details` parameter as shown here `notification_details`_

    Added a new config section in Masakari conf file for configuring the back
    end to be used by taskflow driver::

            [taskflow]
            # The back end for storing recovery_workflow details of the notification.
            # (string value)

            connection = mysql+pymysql://root:admin@127.0.0.1/<db name>?charset=utf8

            # Where db_name, can be a new database or you can also specify masakari
            # database.

    Operator should run `masakari-manage db sync` command to add new db tables
    required for storing recovery_workflow_details.

    Note: When you run `masakari-manage db sync`, make sure you have
    `notification_driver=taskflow_driver` set in masakari.conf.
