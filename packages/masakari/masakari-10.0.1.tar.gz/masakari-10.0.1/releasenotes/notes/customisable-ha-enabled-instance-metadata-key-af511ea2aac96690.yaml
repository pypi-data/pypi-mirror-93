    Adds ``ha_enabled_instance_metadata_key`` config option to ``host_failure``
    and ``instance_failure`` config groups. This option allows operators to
    override the default ``HA_Enabled`` instance metadata key which controls
    the behaviour of Masakari towards the instance. This way one can have
    different keys for different failure types (host vs instance failures).
