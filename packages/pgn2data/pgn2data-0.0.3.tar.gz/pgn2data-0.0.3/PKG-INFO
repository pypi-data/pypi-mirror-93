Description: # pgn2data library
        
        A library that converts a chess pgn files into tabulated data sets.
        
        A pgn file can contain one or multiple chess games. The library parses the pgn file and creates two csv files:
        
        - Games file: contains high level information (e.g. date, site, event, score, players etc...)
        
        - Moves file: contains the moves for each game  (e.g. notation, squares, fen position, is in check etc...)
        
        The two files can be mapped together using a GUID which the process inserts into both files.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following command on the python terminal:
        
            pip install pgn2data
        
        
        ## Implementation
        
        Here is a basic example of how to convert a PGN file:
        
            from converter.pgn_data import PGNData
            
            pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
            result = pgn_data.export()
            result.print_summary()
            
        The Result object is a return value from the process, which allows you to check whether the dataset creation was successful.
        
        To group multiple files into the same output file you can do the following:
        
            pgn_data = PGNData(["file1.pgn","file2.pgn"],"output")
            result = pgn_data.export()
            result.print_summary()
            
        This process the two pgn files in the specified list and exports them to file called "output.csv".
