### Few Words about the package

> The idea behind designing the package was to 
> reduce the unncessary training time for Deep Learning Models.
> The experimentation time if reduced can help the people concerned with
> the package to focus on the finer details which are often neglected. 
> In addition to this, there are several utility functions provided at a single
> place aimed at expediting the ML workflow. These utility functions have been designed
> with ease of use as the foremost priority and attempt has been made to 
> optimize the TPU computation as well as bring in most of the functionalities. Attempt has been made to reduce about 500-700 lines of code or even more (depending on what you are about to use) to less than 10 lines of code. Hope you like it!

# Getting Started
___
***
Let's begin exploring the package. 

## Making Custom Datasets (TFRecords)
---

To obtain the best performance using TPUs, the package accepts only TFRecords Dataset(s). 
Either you have ready-made TFRecords Dataset or you want to obtain TFRecords Dataset for your own image data. This section is devoted to explaining about how to obtain your own Image Dataset TFRecords. <br>
_Note_ -> To utilize the TFRecords dataset created, ensure that the dataset is public while uploading on Kaggle. <br>
_Note_ -> No need to have **TPU ON** for making TFRecords files. Making TFRecords is CPU computation. <br>
_Note_ -> It is better to make TFRecords dataset on Google Colab ( > 75 GB) as Kaggle Kernels have limited Disk Space( < 5 GB). Download the datasets after you are done. Upload them on Kaggle as public datasets. Input the data in the Kaggle Notebooks.

Let's get started with **tfrecords_maker** module of **quick_ml** package. <br>

<br>

**Labeled Data**

For Labeled Data, make sure that the dataset follows the following structure -> 

>/ Data
>>> -Class1 <br>
>>> -Class2 <br>
>>> -Class3 <br>
>>> -ClassN <br>

where Class1, Class2, .. , ClassN denote the folders of images as well the class of the images. These shall serve as the labels for classification.
<br> 
This is usually used for training and validation data. <br>
However, it can also be used to create labeled Test Data.
<br> <br>

To make labeled data, there are 2 options. <br>
* Convert entire image folder to tfrecords file.
 * Split the Image Dataset folder in a specified ratio & make tfrecords files.

<br>
A) Convert entire image folder to tfrecords file <br>

```
from quick_ml.tfrecords_maker import create_tfrecord_labeled
from quick_ml.tfrecords_maker import get_addrs_label
```

To create a tfrecords dataset file from this, the following would be the function call :- <br>

```
create_tfrecord_labeled(addrs, labels, output_filename, IMAGE_SIZE = (192,192))
```

<br>

However, you would need the address (**addrs**) and (**labels**) and shuffle them up. This has been implemented for you in the **get_addrs_label**. Follow the line of code below.<br>

```
addrs, labels = get_addrs_labels(DATA_DIR)
```

<br>
where DATA_DIR directs to the path of the Dataset with the structure mentioned in the beginning of Labeled Data TFRecords. <br>

Obtain the tfrecords file by giving a output_filename you would desire your output file to have using this line of code. <br>

```
create_tfrecord_labeled(addrs, labels, output_filename, IMAGE_SIZE = (192,192))
```

<br>
Ensure that you save the Labeled TFRecord Format somewhere as you would require it to read the data at a later stage. Preferred way of achieving this is through saving it in the Markdown cell below the above code cell. After uploading on Kaggle and making dataset public, adding the Labeled TFRecords Format in the Dataset Description. <br>

B) Split the Image Dataset Folder in a specified ratio & make tfrecords files. <br>

```
from quick_ml.tfrecords_maker import create_split_tfrecords_data
```

To create two tfrecords datasets from the Image Dataset Folder, use the following line of code :- <br>

```
create_split_tfrecords_data(DATA_DIR, outfile1name, outfile2name, split_size_ratio, IMAGE_SIZE = (192,192))
```

<br>

**_DESCRIPTION_** => 

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **DATA_DIR** -> This refers to the Path to the Dataset Folder following the structure mentioned above. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **outfile1name** + **outfile2name** -> Give names to the corresponding output files obtained through the split of the dataset as _outfile1name_ & _outfile2name_. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **split_size_ratio** -> Mention the split size ratio you would to divide your dataset into. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **IMAGE_SIZE** -> The Image Size you would like to set all the images of your dataset in the tfrecords file.

<br>
<br>

<br>

**_RETURNS_** => <br>
Doesn't return anything. Stores the TFRecords file(s) to your disk. Ensure sufficient disk space.

**Unlabeled Data**

For unlabeled data, make sure to follow the following structure. <br>

> / Data
>>> file1 <br>
>>> file2 <br>
>>> file3 <br>
>>> file4 <br>
>>> fileN <br>

where file1, file2, file3, fileN denote the unlabeled, uncategorized image files. The filenames serve as the Id which is paired with the Images as an identification. <br>
This is usually used for test data creation(unknown, unclassified).
<br>  <br>
To make unlabeled TFRecords dataset, you would need **create_tfrecord_unlabeled** & **get_addrs_ids**.

```
from quick_ml.tfrecords_maker import create_tfrecord_unlabeled
from quick_ml.tfrecords_maker import get_addrs_ids
```

<br>

First, obtain the image addresses (**addrs**) and image ids (**ids**) using **get_addrs_ids** in the **tfrecords_maker** module. <br> 

```
addrs, ids = get_addrs_ids(Unlabeled_Data_Dir)
```

<br>
where, <br>
Unlabeled_Data_dir refers to the Dataset Folder which follows the structure of unlabeled dataset. <br>

After getting the addrs & ids, pass the right parameters for the function to make the TFRecords Dataset for you. <br>

```
unlabeled_dataset = create_tfrecord_unlabeled(out_filename, addrs, ids, IMAGE_SIZE = (192,192))
```

**_DESCRIPTION_** => <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**out_filename** - name of the tfrecords outputfile name. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**addrs** - the addrs of the images in the data folder. (can be obtained using get_addrs_ids()) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**ids** - the ids of the imahes in the data folder. (can be obtained using get_addrs_ids()) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**IMAGE_SIZE** - The Image Size of each image you want to have in the TFRecords dataset. Default, (192,192). <br>


**_RETURNS_** => <br>
A TFRecords dataset with examples with 'image' as the first field & 'idnum' as the second field.  

<br>

## Models Training Report
---

This utility function is designed for getting to know which models are the best for the dataset at hand. Manually training models one by one is troublesome as well as cumbersome. A smart and quick way of achieving this is by using the **get_models_training_report()** from **quick_ml.training_predictions**. <br>
To get started, import the **training_predictions** module from **quick_ml** <br>
```
from quick_ml.training_predictions import get_models_training_report
```
<br>

After passing in the arguments for get_models_training_report, you will obtain a pandas dataframe. However, before getting into the details of the output and what are the parameters to be passed to the function, let's take a quick view of the table output format. <br>

### Output Table Overview 
Table Preview of the Pandas DataFrame that is return upon calling the function to obtain training_report. <br>

| Model Name | Train_top1_Accuracy | Train_top3_Accuracy | Val_top1_Accuracy | Val_top3_Accuracy |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Model_1 | 97.1 | 96| 94| 93.1|
| Model_2 |  96.2 | 92 | 93| 91|
| Model_3 |  98| 96| 97.1| 96|
| Model_4 |  90| 87| 85| 83|
| Model_5 |  70| 61|  55| 51|
| Model_6 |  91| 86| 90| 88|

<br>
Table Description :- <br>
1) Model Name -> Name of the model trained on the dataset <br>
2) Top 1 Accuracy -> The last accuracy score on training dataset <br>
3) Top 3 Accuracy -> The average of the last 3 accuracy scores on training dataset<br>
4) Val Top 1 Accuracy -> The last validation accuracy score on validation dataset <br>
5) Val Top 3 Accuracy -> The average of the last 3 validation accuracy scores on validation dataset <br>
<br>

A Pandas Dataframe with a table output as shown above. You can save the function output in a variable and save the dataframe to your disk using .to_csv() method. <br>

## Callbacks
---

In case, the classes of your dataset contain high similarity index, in such cases, it is imperative to have callbacks necessary for your model training and convergence. For obtaining such a model, callbacks are often used. 
This utility aims at providing callbacks which are oftenly used while training deep learning models and returns a list of callbacks. Pass this as an argument while training deep learning models. <br>

```
from quick_ml.callbacks import callbacks
```

##### Learning Rate Scheduler 

There are 3 different types of learning rate schedulers. <br>
    <ol><li> RAMPUP Learning Rate Scheduler
    <li> Simple Learning Rate Scheduler
    <li> Step-wise Learning Rate Scheduler
    </ol>

##### Early Stopping Callback

Use Early Stopping Callback as a measure to prevent the model from overfitting. The default callback setting is as follows <br>
  monitor : 'val_loss', min_delta = 0, patience = 0, verbose = 0, <br>
  mode = 'auto', baseline = None, restore_best_weights = False.
  <br><br>
  
To use the default settings of Early Stopping Callback, pass
```
callbacks = callbacks(early_stopping = "default")
```


  

##### Readuce LR On Plateau

Prevent your model from getting stuck at local minima using ReduceLROnPlataeu callback. The default implementation has the following parameter settings =>  <br>
 'monitor' : 'val_loss', 'factor' : 0.1, 'patience' : 10, 'verbose' : 0, mode = 'auto', min_delta = 0.0001, cooldown = 0, min_lr = 0
 <br> <br>
 
 _**Combine Multiple  callbacks**_ <br>
 ```
 callbacks = callbacks(lr_scheduler = 'rampup', early_stopping = 'default', reduce_lr_on_plateau = 'default' )
 ```
 
 ## Predictions
 ---
 
 The package supports multlipe options to obtain predictions on your testDataset (only TFRecords Format Dataset). <br><br>
 
 Supported Methods for obtaining predictions -> <br>
 - get_predictions
 - ensemble_predictions
    - Model Averaging
    - Model Weighted
    - Train K-Fold (Coming Soon)
    - Test Time Augmentatios (Coming Soon)
    
 ##### Get Predictions

 Obtain predictions on the **TEST TFRECORDS Data Format** using get_predictions(). <br>
 Two call types have been defined for get_predictions(). <br>
 Import the predictions function. <br>
 ```
 from quick_ml.predictions import get_predictions
 ```
 
 First Definition -> <br>
 Use this function definition when you have the GCS_DS_PATH, test_tfrec_path, BATCH_SIZE. <br>
 This is usually helpful when you have a trained model weights from a different session and want to obtain predictions in a different session. Usually beneficial if there are multiple models from whom predictions are to be obtained. Training of multiple models using get_models_training_report() from quick_ml.training_predictions in one session. Saving the best model weights in the same session using create_model() from quick_ml.load_models_quickly. Testing/Predictions in a different session for multiple models using this function definition. This is the best way to deal with multiple models. <br>
 ```
 predictions = get_predictions(GCS_DS_PATH, test_tfrec_path, BATCH_SIZE, model)
 ```

Second Definition <br>
Use this function when you have testTFDataset and model. <br>
This function definition is usually the best option when you have one model and want to obtain the predictions in the same session. For this, you must have loaded the datasets before. However, you are free to explore better possibilites with the above two functions.
```
prediction = get_predictions(testTFdataset, model)
```

<br>

## K-Fold Training & Predictions
---

<br>

K-Fold Cross Validation is usually performed to verify that the selected model's good performance isn't due to data bias. <br>
This would be highly beneficial after obtaining Training Report of the models and you have selected your model architecture you would be working with. <br>

To get started with K-Fold Cross Validation & Predictions, <br>

```
from quick_ml.k_fold_training import train_k_fold_predict
```

<br>
Function Definition :- <br>

```
train_k_fold_predict(k, tpu, train_tfrecs, val_tfrecs, test_tfrecs, GCS_DS_PATH, BATCH_SIZE)
```

<br>

**_Description_** => <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **k** -> The number of folds. Usually, 5 or 10. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **tpu** -> the tpu instance. To be obtained from get_strategy()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **train_tfrecs** -> The complete path location of the tfrecord files of training dataset. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **val_tfrecs** -> The complete path location of the tfrecord files of the validation dataset. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **test_tfrecs** -> The complete path location of the tfrecord files of the test dataset. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **GCS_DS_PATH** -> The Google Cloud Bucket Service Location of the Dataset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **BATCH_SIZE** -> Select the batch size of the training dataset. Usually, the value should be a multiple of 128 for efficient utilization of TPUs. <br>



<br> <br>
**_Returns_** => <br>
Doesn't return anything. Saves an output file with the result of each fold training along with its validation result. <br>


<br>
