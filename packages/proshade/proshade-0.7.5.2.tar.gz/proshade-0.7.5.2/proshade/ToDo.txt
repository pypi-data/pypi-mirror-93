To Do:

* Look into cl warnings (not shown in clang or gcc)

Testing:
* Look into symmetry - especially taking into account the average peak heights when deciding which symmetry to report.
* Look into the limits of structure overlay

Development
* Timing - are band and integration order correctly determined?
* Timing - can it be faster?
* Support non-orthogonal maps
* Change to NFFT and then change the sphere sampling for spherical harmonics, rotation function and angle-axis spheres to Fibonacci sampling.
* Create Homebrew/MacPorts build procedure for MacOS
* Create apt/zypper/yum build procedure for Linux
* Modify the code to use pragmas to include the Windows specific __declspec(dllexport) modifier to make the library usable on Windows.

Admin
* Get new version to CCP-EM including new interface
