/*! \file ProSHADE_exceptions.hpp
    \brief This header  file contains the ProSHADE_exception class, which is used to report errors occuring during run-time.
 
    This file declares the ProSHADE_exception class. This class is derived from runtime_error and is therefore throwable; it extends the standard
    exceptions class by containing a bit more information in a specific format, so that the error messages resulting from throwing this class will be
    a bit more informative.

    \brief This class is the representation of ProSHADE exception.
 
    An object of this class is thrown whenever ProSHADE encounters exceptional case and needs handling it in unusual
    manner. It is a slight expansion on the usual C++ extension class.
