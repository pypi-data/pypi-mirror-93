#   \brief This code demonstrates the usage of the ProSHADE tool in the simple mode for re-boxing a structure.
#
#   This code demonstrates how the ProSHADE python module can be loaded,
#   the settings object created and filled (including all optional values),
#   supplied to the run object and how to retrieve the old as well as the new
#   structure boundaries and the re-boxed structure map/
