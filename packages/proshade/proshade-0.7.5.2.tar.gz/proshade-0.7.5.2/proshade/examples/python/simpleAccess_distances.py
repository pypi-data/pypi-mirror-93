#   \brief This code demonstrates the usage of the ProSHADE tool in the simple mode for distances functionality.
#
#   This code demonstrates how the ProSHADE python module can be loaded,
#   the settings object created and filled (including all optional values),
#   supplied to the run object and how to three descriptor values can be
#   obtained programatically.
