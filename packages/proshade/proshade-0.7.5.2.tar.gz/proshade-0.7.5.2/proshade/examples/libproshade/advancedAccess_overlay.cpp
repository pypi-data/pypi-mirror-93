/*! \file advancedAccess_overlay.cpp
    \brief This file showcases how the ProSHADE structure overlay can be computed using the dynamic library's advanced interface.

    This code is an example of how any C++ project linking the ProSHADE library can access the advanced ProSHADE interface. More specifically, to compute the structure overlay, this example firstly reads in two structures and then removes the phase information
    from both of them. This results in the internal map representation being a Patterson map. Next, these two maps are mapped onto a set of spheres, have their spherical harmonics computed and finally a rotation function map is computed from the two structures'
    spherical harmonics decomposition. From the rottion function, the optimal rotation angles are obtained and the two structures are deleted. Then, the structures are read in again, this time keeping the phase information intact. The moving structure is then processed
    to have its spherical harmonics computed as to allow this structure to be rotated in the spherical harmonics space. Once the moving structure is rotated, the two structures are zero padded to have the same size and have their translation map computed. Finally, from
    this translation map, the optimal translation vector is computed and thus the optimal overlay is obtained.
