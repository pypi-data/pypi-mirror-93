/*! \file simpleAccess_reboxing.cpp
    \brief This file demonstrates how the simple access structure reboxing ProSHADE run can be done using the ProSHADE dynamic library.

    The code shown here demonstrates how the ProSHADE tool can be used in the simple access mode. Note that the simple access mode does not require any user knowledge of the inner workings of ProSHADE
    except for knowing the settings and the values they would like to use; it only requires the user to fill in the settings object and then run proshade. There is also the advanced access interface, which is shown in a
    different file. The code here  shows how the ProSHADE structure re-boxing can be done and how its results can be programatically accessed. To access the re-boxed maps, please read them from disk usig the
    outputted file or use the advanced access code.
