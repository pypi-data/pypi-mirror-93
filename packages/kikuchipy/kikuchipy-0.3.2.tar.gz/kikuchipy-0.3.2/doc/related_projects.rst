EBSD data that users of kikuchipy might find useful:

- `HyperSpy <https://hyperspy.org>`_: Python library with tools for
  multi-dimensional data analysis, which kikuchipy builds upon.
- `EMsoft <http://vbff.materials.cmu.edu/EMsoft>`_: Series of Fortran programs
  which, among numerous other tasks, can perform dictionary indexing of EBSD and
  Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) patterns.
