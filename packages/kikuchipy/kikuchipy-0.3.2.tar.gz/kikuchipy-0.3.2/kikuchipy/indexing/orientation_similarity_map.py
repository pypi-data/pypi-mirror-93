    r"""Compute an orientation similarity map following
    :cite:`marquardt2017quantitative`, where the ranked list of the
    array indices of the best matching simulated patterns in one point
    is compared to the corresponding lists in the nearest neighbour
    points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xmap : ~orix.crystal_map.crystal_map.CrystalMap
        A crystal map with a ranked list of the array indices of the
        best matching simulated patterns among its properties.
    n_best : int, optional
        Number of ranked indices to compare. If None (default), all
        indices are compared.
    simulation_indices_prop : str, optional
        Name of simulated indices array in the crystal maps' properties.
        Default is "simulation_indices".
    normalize : bool, optional
        Whether to normalize the number of equal indices to the range
        [0, 1], by default True.
    from_n_best : int, optional
        Return an OSM for each n in the range [`from_n_best`, `n_best`].
        If None (default), only the OSM for `n_best` indices is
        returned.
    footprint : numpy.ndarray, optional
        Boolean 2D array specifying which neighbouring points to compare
        lists with, by default the four nearest neighbours.
    center_index : int, optional
        Flat index of central navigation point in the truthy values of
        footprint, by default 2.

    Returns
    -------
    osm : numpy.ndarray
        Orientation similarity map(s). If `from_n_best` is not None,
        the returned array has three dimensions, where `n_best` is at
        array[:, :, 0] and `from_n_best` at array[:, :, -1].

    Notes
    -----
    If the set :math:`S_{r,c}` is the ranked list of best matching
    indices for a given point :math:`(r,c)`, then the orientation
    similarity index :math:`\eta_{r,c}` is the average value of the
    cardinalities (\#) of the intersections with the neighbouring sets

    .. math::

        \eta_{r,c} = \frac{1}{4}
            \left(
                \#(S_{r,c} \cap S_{r-1,c}) +
                \#(S_{r,c} \cap S_{r+1,c}) +
