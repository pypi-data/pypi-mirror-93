## Typing stubs for retry

This is an auto-generated PEP 561 type stub package for `retry` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `retry`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/retry. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `ece1a3e525a2970873c9522035a83eade65f4604`.
