What is gffpandas?
##################

gffpandas is a Python library, which can be used for annotation
data. It facilitates the work with GFF3 files in regard to process
them as to obtain desired annotation entries of them. Thereby, it is
an easy to use and time-saving library.

This gffpandas library is an alternative to gffutils or bcbio-gff,
but it is inspired by the Python library pandas. This means that the
data frame structure is used to work with the annotation data, because
gffpandas reads in the GFF3 file and makes a data frame out of
it. With gffpandas it is possible to process a GFF3 file by different
functions. One big advantage is that several functions can be combined
so that the required annotation entries can be selected. Furthermore,
the processed annotation data can be safed again as GFF3 file or as
csv or tsv file.

To see the single functions see `How to use gffpandas`__.
