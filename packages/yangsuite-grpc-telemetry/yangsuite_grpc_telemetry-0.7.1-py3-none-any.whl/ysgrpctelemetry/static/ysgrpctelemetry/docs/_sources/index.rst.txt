Receiving gRPC telemetry with YANG Suite
========================================

From the YANG Suite sidebar menu, select "Protocols â†’ gRPC telemetry".
On the page that appears, enter the IP address of your YANG Suite server
and the port number you wish it to listen on, then click
"Start telemetry receiver".

Configure your telemetry-generating device (router) to send telemetry
updates to this IP address and port, and you will see the telemetry
messages appearing on the page as they are received by YANG Suite.
