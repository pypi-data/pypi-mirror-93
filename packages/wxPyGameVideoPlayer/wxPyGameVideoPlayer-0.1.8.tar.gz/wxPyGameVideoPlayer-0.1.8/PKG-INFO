Description: Just a really simple video player that uses OpenCV, wxPython, and PyGame
        
        Uses OpenCV to load frames from the video file
        
        Uses PyGame (in a non-blocking thread) to acheive fast frame rendering and matplotlib for plotting metrics
        
        A separate wxPython window handles the GUI events
        
        This is forked from a previous project, ca. 4/2007
