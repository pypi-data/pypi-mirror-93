# Colette: Coffee Roulette â€” pair with a random person for coffee

## Usage
Requires Python 3.9 or later installed.

Create a file in subdirectory 'data' called people.csv with at least columns
'name', 'organisation', 'email', and 'active'. 

Each participating (or previously participating) player should be listed in each row. The
active column should contain 'true' if a player is going to participate in new
rounds. Hopefully the other fields are self explanatory.

Run

    python colette.py new

This will generate a new `round*.csv`, with pairs chosen to minimize the number
of people paired together in the same organisation, and those previously
paired. Players are assigned a role in each round, either "organiser" or
"(coffee) buyer". The method attempts to choose pairs that allow people to swap
roles each round.

If you want to mark certain pairs as desired or undesired, create an
"overrides.csv" file in the data directory, listing on each row the name of the two
players and an integer "cost" of adding this pair to the round. This will be
added to the cost of pairing if the players have previously been pair or are in
the same organisation. To prefer a pair, add a negative cost.
