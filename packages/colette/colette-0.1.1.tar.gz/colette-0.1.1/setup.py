The\nactive column should contain \'true\' if a player is going to participate in new\nrounds. Hopefully the other fields are self explanatory.\n\nRun\n\n    python colette.py new\n\nThis will generate a new `round*.csv`, with pairs chosen to minimize the number\nof people paired together in the same organisation, and those previously\npaired. Players are assigned a role in each round, either "organiser" or\n"(coffee) buyer". The method attempts to choose pairs that allow people to swap\nroles each round.\n\nIf you want to mark certain pairs as desired or undesired, create an\n"overrides.csv" file in the data directory, listing on each row the name of the two\nplayers and an integer "cost" of adding this pair to the round. This will be\nadded to the cost of pairing if the players have previously been pair or are in\nthe same organisation. To prefer a pair, add a negative cost.\n',
