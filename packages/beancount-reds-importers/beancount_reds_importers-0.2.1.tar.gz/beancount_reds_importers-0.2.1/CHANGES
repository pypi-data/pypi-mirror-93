beancount_reds_importers: CHANGES
=================================

2021-01-29

 - added the commodity_leaf feature: by default, accounts will now include a commodity
   as their leaf (eg: Assets:Investments:HOOLI). This is configurable. Simply pass in a
   'commodity_leaf: False' in your importer config.

 - the source reader (eg: ofx, csv, ...) has now been separated from the importer type
   (eg: investment, banking, ...). This allows us easy combining of these.
