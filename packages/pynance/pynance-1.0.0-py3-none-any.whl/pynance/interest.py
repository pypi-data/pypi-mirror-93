    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : float
        Interest rate per payment period. Note that if
        payments are monthly and known interest rate is annual,
        `rate` must be calculated as effective *monthly* interest.
    npmts : int
        Number of payments.
    amt : float, optional
        Amount of each payment. Defaults to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    amount : float
        amount of loan
    rate : float
        interest rate for the given payment, i.e., monthly
        interest if the loan is to be paid off monthly.
    npmts : int
        number of payments to be made.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        amount to be paid each period.
