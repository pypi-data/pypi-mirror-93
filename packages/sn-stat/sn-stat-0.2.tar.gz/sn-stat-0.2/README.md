# Supernova shape analysis

Contains collection of method for statistical analysis of the supernova neutrino signals.

Submodules:

* `sn_stat.rate`: Object defining event rate vs. time
* `sn_stat.sampler`: Generating random samples from given rates. Useful for fake data simulation
* `sn_stat.llr`:  Calculation of Log Likelihood Ratio for the shape analysis
* `sn_stat.sig_calc`:  Significance calculator for set of experiments. Can be used for joint analysis
