        `zuul-announce <http://lists.zuul-ci.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zuul-announce>`_
          A low-traffic announcement-only list to which every Zuul operator or
          power-user should subscribe.
        
        `zuul-discuss <http://lists.zuul-ci.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zuul-discuss>`_
          General discussion about Zuul, including questions about how to use
          it, and future development.
        
        You will also find Zuul developers in the `#zuul` channel on Freenode
