# ytam - YouTube Album Maker

A commandline utility that enables the creation of albums from Youtube playlists.

## Getting Started

<!--These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

### Prerequisites

To be able to use the mp4 to mp3 conversion feature, ffmpeg must be installed.

#### Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

#### Windows:

- Download ffmpeg binaries from [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds)
- Add the bin\\ directory to Windows PATH
 
### Installing
ytam depends on the latest patch of pytube, which is not yet incorporated into its official release. Until this happens, first install the patch using:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube
```

Then:

```
pip install ytam
```

Usage:

```
usage: ytam [-h] [-t TITLES] [-d DIRECTORY] [-s START] [-e END] [-A ALBUM]
            [-a ARTIST] [-i IMAGE] [-p PROXY] [-3 [MP3]] [-k [CHECK]]
            URL

positional arguments:
  URL                   the target URL of the playlist to download

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TITLES, --titles TITLES
                        a plain text file containing the desired titles and
                        artists of the songs in the playlist, each on a new
                        line. Format: title<@>artist
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        the download directory (defaults to 'music' - a
                        subdirectory of the current directory)
  -s START, --start START
                        from which position in the playlist to start
                        downloading (defaults to 1)
  -e END, --end END     position in the playlist of the last song to be
                        downloaded (defaults to last position in the playlist)
  -A ALBUM, --album ALBUM
                        the name of the album that the songs in the playlist
                        belongs to (defaults to playlist title)
  -a ARTIST, --artist ARTIST
                        the name of the artist that performed the songs in the
                        playlist (defaults to Unknown)
  -i IMAGE, --image IMAGE
                        the path to the image to be used as the album cover.
                        Only works when -A flag is set
  -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY
                        list of proxies to use. Must be enclosed in string
                        quotes with a space separating each proxy. Proxy
                        format: <protocol>-<proxy>
  -3 [MP3], --mp3 [MP3]
                        converts downloaded files to mp3 format and deletes
                        original mp4 file. Requires ffmpeg to be installed on
                        your machine
  -k [CHECK], --check [CHECK]
                        checks whether ytam is working as it should by trying
                        to download a pre-defined playlist and setting pre-
                        defined metadata. Setting this argument causes ytam to
                        ignore ALL others
```
