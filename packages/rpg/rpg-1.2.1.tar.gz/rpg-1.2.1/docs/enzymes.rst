==================
Enzyme definitions
==================
All default available enzymes (`enzymes_definition.py`) are listed bellow.

For each of them, there is the equivalent in `RPG` grammar.

In the following, nomenclature of `Schechter and Berger <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6035483>`_ is used. Amino acids before the cleavage site are designated as `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, etc in the N-terminal direction, and as `P1'`, `P2'`, `P3'`, etc in the C-terminal direction. For example, with cleavage site represented as '|':

.. code-block:: none

    ...P3-P2-P1-|-P1'-P2'-P3'...

In **RPG**, this nomenclature is represented as:

.. code-block:: none

    ...(P3)(P2)(P1)(,)(P1')(P2')(P3')...
