# mserv
A simple wrapper for managing your Minecraft servers.

## What is it?
Mserv is a little commandline utility I wrote in Python to help me better
manage my, and my friends' Minecraft servers.  

Mojang offers a DIY *server.jar* file 
which you can execute and host a server on your own PC for free. But, what if I wanted
separate servers? What if I don't care to go to the Minecraft website and download the file myself?
Or, what if I don't care to remember the server execution parameters?  

Mserv serves to simplify many of these processes, and should make efforts to help those less tech-savvy.

## What can it do?
This is a wrapper around the official server.jar from Mojang
As of right now, it can...

- Download and generate files from the official server executable
- Start and shutdown the server
- Displays network connection information (public ip, port number) so others can join your server
- Can update the server executable (This is still in testing)
- Update itself (just run ```pip install --upgrade mserv```)

## What can it NOT do?
This script can not:
- Port forward for you (You have to do that yourself)
- Execute multiple servers at the same time

# Requirements
1. Java
2. Python version 3.8 or above

# Installation

1. EASY - Use Python's package manager pip:
  ```shell
  pip install mserv
  ```

or  

2. TRICKY - Clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mexiquin/mserv.git
```  

Then execute mserv.py located in the *mserv* directory
```shell
python3 ./mserv/mserv/mserv.py
```
