        `Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension for playing music from
        `Bandcamp <http://bandcamp.com/>`_.
        
        This backend does not support authentication and listening to high quality
        streams in your collection.  I'd love to support that if someone wants to
        reverse-engineer the X-Bandcamp-DM and X-Bandcamp-PoW headers.  In the
        meantime, this allows searching bandcamp and playing the free 128kbps
        streams.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running::
        
            sudo pip install Mopidy-Bandcamp
        
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Before starting Mopidy, you must enable Mopidy-Bandcamp in 
        the Mopidy configuration file::
        
            [bandcamp]
            enabled = true
        
        Other Configuration Options
        ---------------------------
        
        - :code:`art_url_as_comment` - a hack to set the album art url as the track comment.  Default: false
        - :code:`discover_pages` - Number of pages to load in the browse discover sections.  Default: 1
        - :code:`discover_genres` - List of bandcamp's genres to discover.  You'll only want to edit this to remove unwanted genres.
        - :code:`discover_tags` - List of bandcamp tags to discover. You'll really want to change this to any tags that interest you.
