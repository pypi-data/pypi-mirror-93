Types
-----

.. note::

    Even though these types **are** made for public consumption and usage
    should be encouraged/easily possible it should be noted that these may be
    moved out to new libraries at various points in the future. If you are
    using these types **without** using the rest of this library it is
    **strongly** encouraged that you be a vocal proponent of getting these made
    into *isolated* libraries (as using these types in this manner is not
    the expected and/or desired usage).
