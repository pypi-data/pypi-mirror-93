General documentation for model fitting is below.  There are several multi-component model fitting tools that have been developed based on pyspeckit:

 * `Mike Chen's multi-vlsr <https://github.com/mcyc/multi_vlsr>`_
 * `Vlas Sokolov's pyspecnest <https://github.com/vlas-sokolov/pyspecnest>`_ and `multicube <https://github.com/vlas-sokolov/multicube>`_
 * `Jonny Henshaw's SCOUSE <https://github.com/jdhenshaw/scousepy>`_
