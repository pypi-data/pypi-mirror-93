class Bitbucket(Storage):
    """
    Bitbucket storage class. This class represents the Storage interface for Flows stored
    in `.py` files in a Bitbucket repository. This is for Bitbucket Server only.

    This class represents a mapping of flow name to file paths contained in the git repo,
    meaning that all flow files should be pushed independently. A typical workflow using
    this storage type might look like the following:

    - Compose flow `.py` file where flow has Bitbucket storage:

    ```python
    flow = Flow("my-flow")
    flow.storage = Bitbucket(
        project="my.project", repo="my.repo", path="/flows/flow.py", ref="my-branch"
    )
    ```

    - Push this `flow.py` file to the `my.repo` repository under `/flows/flow.py` inside "my.project"
        project.

    - Call `prefect register -f flow.py` to register this flow with Bitbucket storage.

    Args:
        - project (str): Project that the repository will be in.  Not equivalent to a GitHub project;
            required value for all Bitbucket repositories.
        - repo (str): the repository name, with complete taxonomy.
        - host (str, optional): If using Bitbucket server, the server host. If not specified, defaults
            to Bitbucket cloud.
        - path (str, optional): a path pointing to a flow file in the repo
        - ref (str, optional): a commit SHA-1 value or branch name
        - **kwargs (Any, optional): any additional `Storage` initialization options
