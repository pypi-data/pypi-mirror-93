        # Flask Environment Manager
        
        # Installation
        Install and update using `pip`:
        
        ```bash 
        pip install -U flask-environment-manager
        ```
        
        # Developing
        __The build pipeline requires your tests to pass and code to be formatted__
        
        Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine (use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)).
        
        Install the dependencies with [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) (making sure to include dev and pre-release packages):
        
        ```bash
        pipenv install --dev --pre
        ```
        
        Configure your environment:
        
        ```bash
        pipenv shell && export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"
        ```
        
        Run the tests:
        
        ```bash
        pytest
        ```
        
        Or with logging:
        
        ```bash
        pytest -s
        ```
        
        Or tests with coverage:
        
        ```bash
        pytest --cov=./
        ```
        
        Format the code with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black):
        
        ```bash
        black $PWD
        ```
        
        # Releases
        Cleanup the (.gitignored) `dist` folder (if you have one):
        
        ```bash
        rm -rf dist
        ```
        
        Notch up the version number in `setup.py` and build:
        
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        Push to PyPi (using the ScholarPack credentials when prompted)
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
        ```
