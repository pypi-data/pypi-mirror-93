    There may be only one active BT per thread.  Attempts to start subsequent BTs

    Consider using the ``bt`` context manager instead in cases where you start
    and end the BT in the same code (i.e., where you can wrap the whole BT in
    a ``with`` statement).

    Examples
    --------
    Given the code::

        setup()
        do_work()
        teardown()

    If you want to report ``do_work`` as a business transaction, you can either
    use ``start_bt`` and ``end_bt`` like so::

    Or you can use the ``bt`` context manager::

        setup()

        with bt('do work'):
            do_work()

        teardown()

    The latter is preferable, but only available when the BT starts and ends
    in the same context.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name to give the BT in the controller.

    correlation_header : str, optional
        If specified, a correlation header that has been generated by another
        AppDynamics agent and passed to this agent as a ``str``.

            for dept, total in salaries_by_dept.extract('dept', 'total'):
                report_salary_data(dept, total)

    You can wrap it in a business transaction and report a custom exit call

        FINANCIALS_ID_PROPS = {'Host': 'financials-lb', 'Port': 3456, 'Vendor': 'CUSTOM DB'}

                for dept, total in salaries_by_dept.extract('dept', 'total'):

            finally:
                end_exit_call(exit_call, exc)

    Alternatively, in cases like the above, you can use the ``exit_call``
    decorator to simplify the code::

        from appdynamics.agent import api as appd
        appd.init()

        FINANCIALS_ID_PROPS = {'Host': 'financials-lb', 'Port': 3456, 'Vendor': 'custom db'}

                    report_salary_data(dept, total)

    Parameters
    ----------
    bt_handle : BtHandle
        A handle for a business transaction
    exit_type : int
    display_name : str
        The first time an exit call with the given identifying properties is
        made, its display name in the controller will be set to whatever you
        pass here. This shows up in the UI as the label on the flow map.
    identifying_properties : dict
        Identifying properties are a set of name-value string pairs (a dict)
        that uniquely identify the downstream component. For example, for a
        database, the identifying properties might be the vendor of the
        database (e.g., "SQL Server"), the host name and port, and the
        name of the database. The key of the dict is the name of the
        property; the value is the value of the property.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    operation : str, optional
        A string describing the operation that is being performed, such as
        the URL of an HTTP request or a SQL query for a DB.
    optional_properties : dict, optional
        If specified, a dictionary of optional properties that will be shown
        in the controller UI for this exit call.
    exit_subtype : str, optional
        For CUSTOM exit point types, provide a subtype string to identify the
        backend type.

    Returns
    -------
    ExitCallHandle
        A handle that identifies this exit call, for passing to
        ``end_exit_call`` or ``make_correlation_header``.

    See Also
    --------
    end_exit_call : Must be called to end the exit call. If any exit calls
                    aren't ended when the BT is ended, then they are all
                    ended when the BT is ended.

                and ``end_exit_call`` around your code.

        TIME_AVERAGE (the default) takes the average of all values in the last

        CURRENT takes the last reported value in the previous interval.
    cluster_rollup_type : api.INDIVIDUAL (default) or api.COLLECTIVE

        COLLECTIVE adds the values from each node in the tier.
    hole_handling_type : api.REGULAR_COUNTER (default) or api.RATE_COUNTER

    Yields
    ------
    BtHandle
        A handle for passing this BT to other functions, such as to ``start_exit_call``.


    Examples
    --------

    If you have some code that looks like this::

        do_some_work()
        more_work()
        something_else()

    To report this section of code as a business transaction, modify it to
    read::

        with appdynamics.agent.api.bt('important work'):
            do_some_work()
            more_work()
            something_else()

    With this change, you can then look in the AppDynamics controller to see
    how often this section of code is hit, how long it takes for this code to
    run (down to the timing for individual lines of code), supported exit
    calls made from within this section of code (e.g., calls to MySQL,
    PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached, HTTP clients, etc.), any uncaught
    exceptions raised by this code, and more.

    This function takes the same argument as ``start_bt``.

    See Also
    --------
    start_bt : If you need to start and end the BT in different places in your
               code, you can explicitly use ``start_bt`` and ``end_bt``.

    ------

    Examples
    --------
    If you have code which looks like this::
