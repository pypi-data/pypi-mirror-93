An CSAR file upload greater than the size mentioned here would result

      consideration and must be set less than or equal to
      8 EiB (~9223372036).
    * This value must be set with careful consideration of the
      backend storage capacity. Setting this to a very low value
      may result in a large number of image failures. And, setting
      this to a very large value may result in faster consumption
      of storage. Hence, this must be set according to the nature of
      images created and storage capacity available.
