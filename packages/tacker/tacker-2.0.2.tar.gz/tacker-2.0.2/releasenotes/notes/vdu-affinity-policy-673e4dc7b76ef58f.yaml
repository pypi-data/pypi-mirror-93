    Added placement policy support. Operator can specify below placement
    policies in addition to `affinity` to VDU's:

    * ``anti-affinity``
    * ``soft-affinity``
    * ``soft-anti-affinity``

    Note: There is a known issue in nova that `late anti-affinity check`_ doesn't work
    in multi-cells environment. So it is highly recommended to deploy nova in single cell
    environment until this issue is resolved in multi-cells environment.

    .. _`late anti-affinity check`: https://docs.openstack.org/nova/pike/user/cellsv2_layout.html#operations-requiring-upcalls
