    "OS::Aodh::GnocchiAggregationByResourcesAlarm"
    2. Add "resource_type" fixed with value "instance"
    3. Change some paramters (meter_name-> metric, statistic ->
    aggregation_method, period-> granularity)
    4. Change value from "average" to "mean" in method to compare
    to the threshold
