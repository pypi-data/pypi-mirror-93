    Added new RESTful APIs for managing VNF packages required for managing the
    lifecycle of a VNF. See the `spec`_ for more details.

    .. note:: VNF create API can create a VNF using a VNFD registered by
      VNFD create API only. VNF creation and instantiation using VNF package
      will be made available in future release.
