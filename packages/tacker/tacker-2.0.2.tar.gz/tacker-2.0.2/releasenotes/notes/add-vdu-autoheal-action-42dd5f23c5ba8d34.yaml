    Added a new monitoring policy action ``vdu_autoheal`` to bring back the
    failed VDU. If a VNF contains one or more VDUs with monitoring policy
    action set to `vdu_autoheal` and if any one of the VDU is unreachable,
    it will simply delete the resources of that particular VDUs and re-create
    them again.

    The `vdu_autoheal` monitoring policy action is implemented only for
    openstack infra driver.
