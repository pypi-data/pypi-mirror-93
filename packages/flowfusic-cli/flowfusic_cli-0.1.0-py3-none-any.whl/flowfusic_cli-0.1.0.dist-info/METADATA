# flowfusic-cli

Flowfusic's command line tool for project visualization. The CLI connects your Flowfusic projects with your local Paraview postprocessing software.

Quick Start
-----------

1.  Create a free Flowfusic account at [flowfusic.com]()

2. Install the cli:

   ```
   $ pip install flowfusic-cli
   ```

3. Login with the cli by typing:

```
$ flowfusic login
```

This step will open a web browser and ask for your login credentials.

4. You can now visualize your Flowfusic projects using Paraview by running

   ``` flowfusic paraview --paraview PATH/TO/PARAVIEW ```

   Note that if paraview is already accessible in your path, it is sufficient to run

   ``` flowfusic paraview ```
