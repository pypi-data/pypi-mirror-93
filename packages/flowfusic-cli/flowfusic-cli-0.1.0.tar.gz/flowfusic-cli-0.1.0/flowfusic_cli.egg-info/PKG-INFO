        # flowfusic-cli
        
        Flowfusic's command line tool for project visualization. The CLI connects your Flowfusic projects with your local Paraview postprocessing software.
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        1.  Create a free Flowfusic account at [flowfusic.com]()
        
        2. Install the cli:
        
           ```
           $ pip install flowfusic-cli
           ```
        
        3. Login with the cli by typing:
        
        ```
        $ flowfusic login
        ```
        
        This step will open a web browser and ask for your login credentials.
        
        4. You can now visualize your Flowfusic projects using Paraview by running
        
           ``` flowfusic paraview --paraview PATH/TO/PARAVIEW ```
        
           Note that if paraview is already accessible in your path, it is sufficient to run
        
           ``` flowfusic paraview ```
