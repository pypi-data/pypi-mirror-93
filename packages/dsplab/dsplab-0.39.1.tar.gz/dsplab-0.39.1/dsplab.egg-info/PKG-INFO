Description: In a different subject areas, data analysis tasks exist in which a
        certain general structure is distinguished, while the number of
        possible methods for implementing subtasks increases. The question
        arises: which combination of methods is better? Dsplab allows you to
        describe the overall scheme of the task (plan) and assign the
        so-called "workers" to perform the subtasks. So the main field of
        application of dsplab is the investigation of variety of methods
        solving the same signal processing task.
