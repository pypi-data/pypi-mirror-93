        ![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cacao-accounting/open-marquesote/main/preview.JPG)
        
        Live sample can be found at [Cacao Accounting Desktop](https://github.com/cacao-accounting/cacao-accounting-desktop/blob/master/cacao_desktop.py),
        just replace the app to be served with your own project, please note that we recomend the [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/arguments.html#arguments) WSGI server
        since it is croos plataform, [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) olny runs in Unix.
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        # example.py
        import subprocess
        import time
        from sys import argv, executable
        from flask import Flask
        from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
        from open_marquesote import MainWindow
        from waitress import serve
        
        flaskapp = Flask(__name__)
        
        
        @flaskapp.route("/")
        def app():
            return "A python web app running like desktop app."
        
        
        def server():
            try:
                serve(flaskapp, threads=2, port=9889)
            except OSError:
                # If the server was started before and is still running there will be a OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use
                # Since the server is already up and running we pass this error.
                pass
        
        
        def browser():
            time.sleep(5)  # Give 5 seconds to the WSGI server to start.
            browser = QApplication(argv)
            window = MainWindow(url="http://127.0.0.1:9889/", appname="Python web in Desktop")
            browser.exec_()
        
        
        def run():
            subprocess.Popen(
                [executable, "-c", "import example; example.server()"],
                stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
                stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL,
            )
            subprocess.Popen([executable, "-c", "import example; example.browser()"])
        
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            run()
        ```
        
        ```bash
