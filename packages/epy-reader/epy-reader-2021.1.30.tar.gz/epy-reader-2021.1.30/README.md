CLI Ebook Reader.

This is just a fork of my own [epr](https://github.com/wustho/epr) with these extra features:

- Supported formats:
  - Epub (.epub, .epub3)
  - FictionBook (.fb2)
  - Mobi (.mobi), but image is not supported in mobi
  - AZW3 (.azw3), some but not all (see [KindleUnpack](https://github.com/kevinhendricks/KindleUnpack))
- Reading progress percentage
- Bookmarks
- External dictionary integration
- Inline formats: **bold** and _italic_ (depend on terminal and font capability. Italic only supported in python>=3.7)

# Reading Tips Using Epy

When reading using `epy` you might occasionally find triple asteriks `***`.
That means you reach the end of some section in your ebook and the next line (right after those three asteriks, which is in new section) will start at the top of the page.
This might be disorienting, so the best way to get seamless reading experience is by using next-page control (`space`, `l` or `Right`) instead of next-line control (`j` or `Down`).
