> Bag of, not words, but tricks!

This project contains a couple of scikit-learn compatible "tricks" that I've used in
NLP experiments. It's a collection of tricks for sparse data.

## SubModules

1. `.prep`: Contains string pre-processing tools. Takes a string in and pushes a string out.  
2. `.tok`: Contains things that take stings and output iterables.
