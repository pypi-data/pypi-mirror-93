# python `sliding1d` library

a library for sliding-window computation.

## Dependencies

Probably it only works on Python 3 (not on Python 2) as I took zero care about it.

It uses the following libraries (presumably handled automatically in pip):

1. [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
2. [bottleneck](https://github.com/kwgoodman/bottleneck)

## Installation

You can directly install it via pip:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/gwappa/python-sliding1d.git
```

Alternatively, you can first clone the Git repository and then perform local installation:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gwappa/python-sliding1d.git
$ cd python-sliding1d
$ pip install .
```

In both cases, note that you may need to add the `--user` option, to install the package without administrative previleges.
