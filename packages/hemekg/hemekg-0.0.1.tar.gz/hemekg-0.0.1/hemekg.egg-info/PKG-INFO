Description: HemeKG
        ======
        Assembling and modeling the knowledge around heme pathogenicity and pathway dysregulation in the context of hemolytic
        disorders. The data hosted in this repo was curated by `Farah Humayun <https://github.com/Fahumayun>`_ in context of her
        Master's Thesis. The curated documents are located in the ``hemekg`` directory.

        Installation
        ------------
        To install the ``hemekg`` python package for programmatic access to
        the BEL files in this repository, use the following code in your shell:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/hemekg/hemekg.git
            $ cd hemekg
            $ pip install -e .
        
        Commands
        --------
        To see all the commands, simply run:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ hemekg
        
        Usage
        -----
        To get the BEL graph, use the following code:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> import hemekg
            >>> graph = hemekg.get_graph()
            >>> graph.summarize()
