I believe I am an ideal fit at FRBP as a Machine Learning Economist given my related research in market
microstructure, macroeconomics, and economic policy as well as technical skills related to developing economic
models and communicating insights from large quantities of data. 
I have applied machine learning and textual analysis in my research, have given numerous informal seminars 
to fellow Ph.D students on programming topics such as machine learning and Python for research applications, 
and I am widely viewed in the department as a resource on such topics. 
I am familiar with banking supervisory work
from both ends: I was an intern in the Credit Risk department at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and I
worked directly with bank examiners in my role as a Portfolio Analyst rebuilding the models for the Allowance
for Loan and Lease Losses at Eastern Virginia Bankshares. I have a strong interest in regulatory issues in
financial markets and am equally comfortable being both self-guided and a team player providing high-quality
results and recommendations. On a personal level, my wife and I have an affinity for larger cities and we have
family close by so Philadelphia seems like a good fit.

applied econometrics with a focus on machine learning. I have applied machine learning and textual

empirical finance and economics research, especially around extracting meaning out of

I have given numerous informal seminars to fellow

I believe I am an ideal fit at BU as you are looking for an applicant in the area of
FinTech. My job market paper is focused on cryptoassets and I am exploring research ideas in the 
decentralized finance space enabled by blockchain technology. I have applied machine learning and textual 
analysis in my research, and I have deep expertise in programming and 
data science. I hope to further our understanding on how machine learning can be applied in 
empirical finance and economics research, especially around extracting meaning out of 
the predictions made by such models. Beyond my multiple full undergraduate courses, 
I have given numerous informal seminars to fellow
Ph.D students on programming topics such as machine learning and Python for research applications, 
and I am widely viewed in the department as a resource on such topics. I believe the industry is headed 
more towards quantitative finance, machine learning, and big data, and I would be excited about the opportunity 
to teach students these skills. On a personal level, my wife and I have an affinity for larger cities and we have
family close by so Boston seems like a good fit.

I believe I am an ideal fit at BU as you are looking for an applicant in the area of
FinTech. My job market paper is focused on cryptoassets and I am exploring research ideas in the 
decentralized finance space enabled by blockchain technology. I have applied machine learning and textual 
analysis in my research, and I have deep expertise in programming and 
data science. I hope to further our understanding on how machine learning can be applied in 
empirical finance and economics research, especially around extracting meaning out of 
the predictions made by such models. Beyond my multiple full undergraduate courses, 
I have given numerous informal seminars to fellow
Ph.D students on programming topics such as machine learning and Python for research applications, 
and I am widely viewed in the department as a resource on such topics. I believe the industry is headed 
more towards quantitative finance, machine learning, and big data, and I would be excited about the opportunity 
to teach students these skills. On a personal level, my wife and I enjoy outdoor activities so
Mansfield seems like a good fit.

I believe I am an ideal fit at OCC CCRAD as a Financial Economist given my related research in asset pricing,
market microstructure, 
macroeconomics, and economic policy as well as technical skills related to developing economic models and
communicating insights from large quantities of data. I am familiar with banking supervisory work from both ends: 
I was an intern in the Credit Risk department at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and 
I worked directly with examiners in my 
role as a Portfolio Analyst rebuilding the models for the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and developing 
a stress testing program at 
Eastern Virginia Bankshares. 
I have a strong interest in regulatory issues in financial
markets and am equally comfortable being both self-guided and a team player providing high-quality results and
recommendations. I am a U.S. citizen so I look forward to serving my country in this capacity.
On a personal level, my wife and I both 
have an affinity for larger cities and my family is in Northern Virginia so DC would be a 
great location for us.
