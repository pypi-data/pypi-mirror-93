Assetic ESRI integration SDK
============================
This package provides tools that can be used to assist with integration between Assetic and ESRI.  The tools may be included in the ArcMap python add-in, or in scripts run outside of the ArcMap desktop environment



**Changelog**

**Release 1.2.0.3**
        * Moved common GIS functionality to shared Assetic Python SDK (pypi: assetic)

**Release 1.2.0.2**
        * Fix issue where functional location not created if type defined by
          an attribute field rather than a default

**Release 1.2.0.1**
        * Fix issue where spatial upload was skipped in some circumstances

**Release 1.2.0.0**
        * Introduced support for layers with no spatial data, i.e. tables
        * Allow for updating components of the same type by including
          component name when obtaining the component to update
        * Ensure log level is correctly set

**Release 1.1.3.2**
        *   Improve messaging if missing configuration

**Release 1.1.3.1**
        *   Cater for partial asset creation whereby the asset is created
            but a component, dimension, or functional location association
            fails.  Reported as a partial success, and the GIS is updated
            with the asset Id and optionally the component ID if created
        *   Requires the assetic python package 2020.6.1.1 as a minimum

**Release 1.1.2.1**
        *   Support configuration where id not a functional location field
        *   Improve messaging around missing configurations

**Release 1.1.2.0**
        *   Add option to apply custom calculation script that allows
            fields from layer to be used to derive new fields to be used for
            input to Assetic.  The derived field does not need to be in the layer

**Release 1.1.1.1**
        *   Add XML configuration option to set threshold at which bulk
            update occurs via Data Exchange rather than per asset

**Release 1.1.1.0**
        *   Introduced support for creating and updating Functional Location for a Functional Location layer
        *   Introduced support for associating an asset with a Functional Location on asset creation or update
        *   Introduced bulk update process where feature count exceeds 250.
            Data Exchange is used to apply the updates as it is a more
            efficient process for large volume updates.

**Release 1.0.1.14**
        *   Fix issue caused by missing bracket in version check

**Release 1.0.1.13**
        *   Check the Assetic folder exists in %APPDATA% and if not create it
        *   Fix issue reading XML configuration setting for upload_spatial

**Release 1.0.1.12**
        *   When initiating the settings in the xml configuration file will be
            used in preference to the passed in logfile name and level

        *   Prior to initialisation of the logging, unhandled errors will be
            written to %APPDATA%/assetic/addin.log

**Release 1.0.1.10**
        *   Cater for multiple network measure addition records against a
            single component provided the shape differs for each

**Release 1.0.1.9**
        *   Cater for arcs/circles in polygon and polyline definitions
        *   Add arcpy Progressor option for progress messages when using
            model builder

**Release 1.0.1.8**
        *   On asset creation the status did not match the layer configuration

**Release 1.0.1.7**
        *   Add support for creating and updating Component, Dimension and Address, standardise spatial upload.
        *   Improve error logging to catch unhandled exceptions
        *   Minimum required Assetic package is 2019.2.3.0

**Release 1.0.1.6**
		*	Correct potential issue with unsupported spatial data upload

**Release 1.0.1.5**
		*	Add property config.force_use_arcpy_addmessage as boolean.  
			If using Model Builder in ArcMap it ensures messages are written to the	Model Builder run dialog rather than a separate
			pop-up dialog that can get lost behind the Model Builder dialog.  Default = False
**Release 1.0.1.4**
        *	Allow a filter to be provided on asset creation

		*	Correct issue with setting log file
**Release 1.0.1.1**
        *	Publish to pypi
**Release 1.0.1.0**
        *	Include default field configuration option
