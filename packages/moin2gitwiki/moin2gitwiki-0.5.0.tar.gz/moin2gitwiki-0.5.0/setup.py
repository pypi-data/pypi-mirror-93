This is\nthen reduced to just the page content (by picking out the content div from the\nhtml), and some light editing applied to simplify the HTML - specifically:-\n\n- Remove the anchor spans that MoinMoin adds - these add no visual or\n  readable content, but confuse the translator\n- Remove paragraph entries with CSS classes that start `line` - these\n  again appear to be for non-required purposes (likely for showing diffs\n  between revisions) - and they break the translator\n- Fix links that point within the wiki - if the target does not exist\n  then the text is left but the link removed.\n- Strips CSS classes off links - again these upset the translator\n- Translate any images that appear to be MoinMoin emoji characters (which\n  are rendered as images) into gollum emoji characters\n\nThis simplified HTML is then passed through the pandoc command:-\n\n    pandoc -f html -t gfm\n\nAnd the resulting Github flavoured Markdown is taken as the new form.\n\nThis handles the vast majority of normal markup correctly, including lists and\nmany types of tables.  Some complicated markup or complex tables end up being\npassed through as HTML - which displays correctly but is less easy to parse\nand edit.\n\nAttachments that are available in the wiki are also handled - they are put\ninto a `_attachments` directory under a subdirectory named for the original\npage directory name.  Links to attachments should be handled correctly.\n\n## Issues\n\nThe overall process is not particularly fast.  But this should be something\nyou only do once (or a few attempts) so raw speed is not needed.\n\nAttachments are not versioned by MoinMon.  This means any attachment that was\ndeleted from MoinMoin is no longer available to put into the converted wiki.\nAny attachment that was updated a few times is only available in the last\nversion (but will probably be inserted into the history at the point where it\nfirst appeared but with the latest content).\n\n## Installation\n\nI have now made this available as a pypi package, in which case it can be\ninstalled by running\n\n    pip install moin2gitwiki\n\nHowever to use it you will also need to install the `pandoc` and `git`\npackages as these commands are run during the conversion.\n\nHowever it can be installed from the repo - it uses\n[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependancies etc, so the best\nway to make use of this is to install [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/)\nfor your python version and then:-\n\n    poetry install\n\nthe command can then be run as\n\n    poetry run moin2gitwiki ...\n\n## Todo\n\n- Make tests effective\n\n----\n',
