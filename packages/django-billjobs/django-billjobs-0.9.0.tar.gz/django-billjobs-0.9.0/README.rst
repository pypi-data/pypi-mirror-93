**Warning: I maintain this project 2/3 times a year.** If you start a new coworking space as a french non-profit
organization, this project could help you on the first time. Otherwise, it must be wiser to use another peace of
software.

A django billing app for coworking space.

We intend to keep things as simple as we can and with an easy user experience. This apps is designed to manage invoices
of coworkers.

**No tax management**. There is no tax for non-profit organization in
France. This application doesn't manage tax, it only displays legal
French informations and tax 0% on bills.

We use it at `Cowork'in Montpellier <http://www.coworkinmontpellier.org>`__ and `Le Vîllage <https://www.levillage.co/>`__, 
and `Sète en Commun <https://www.facebook.com/Setencommun/>`__ three coworking spaces in South of France
