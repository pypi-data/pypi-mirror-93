# anlearn - Anomaly learn

In [Gauss Algorithmic], we're working on many anomaly/fraud detection projects using open-source tools. We decided to put our two cents in and  "tidy up" some of our code snippets, add documentation, examples, and release them as an open-source package. So let me introduce **anlearn**. It aims to offer multiple interesting anomaly detection methods in familiar [scikit-learn] API so you could quickly try some anomaly detection experiments yourself.

So far, this package is an alpha state and ready for your experiments.

Do you have any questions, suggestions, or want to chat? Feel free to contact us via [Github], [Gitter], or email.

## Installation
anlearn depends on [scikit-learn] and it's dependencies [scipy] and [numpy].

Requirements:
* python >=3.6
* [scikit-learn]
* [scipy]
* [numpy]

Requirements for every supported python version with version and hashes could be found in `requirements` folder.
We're using [pip-tools] for generating requirements files.
