![Using lastversion in terminal](https://www.getpagespeed.com/img/lastversion.gif)

English | [简体中文](README-ZH-CN.md)

A tiny command-line utility that helps to answer a simple question:

> What is the latest *stable* version for a project?

... and, optionally, download/install it.

`lastversion` allows finding well-formatted the latest release version of a project from these 
 supported locations:

*   [GitHub](https://github.com/dvershinin/lastversion/wiki/GitHub-specifics)
*   GitLab
*   BitBucket
*   PyPI
*   Mercurial
*   SourceForge
*   Arbitrary software sites which publish release in RSS/ATOM feeds

## Why you need `lastversion`

In general, quite many project authors complicate finding the latest version by:

*   Creating a formal release that is clearly a Release Candidate (`rc` in tag), but forgetting to
    mark it as a pre-release
*   Putting extraneous text in release tag e.g. `release-1.2.3` or `name-1.2.3-2019` anything fancy 
    like that
*   Putting or not putting the `v` prefix inside release tags. Today yes, tomorrow not. I'm not
    consistent about it myself :)
*   Switching from one version format to another, e.g. `v20150121` to `v2.0.1`

There is no consistency in human beings.

To deal with all this mess and simply get well-formatted, last *stable* version (or download URL!) 
on the command line, you can use `lastversion`.

Its primary use is for build systems - whenever you want to watch specific projects for released
versions to build packages automatically.
Or otherwise require getting the latest version in your automation scripts.

[Like I do](https://www.getpagespeed.com/redhat)

`lastversion` does a little bit of AI to detect if releasers mistakenly filed a beta version as a 
stable release.
It incorporates logic for cleaning up human inconsistency from 
version information.

## Synopsis

```bash
lastversion apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx 
#> 1.13.35.2

lastversion apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx -d 
#> downloaded incubator-pagespeed-ngx-v1.13.35.2-stable.tar.gz

lastversion apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx -d pagespeed.tar.gz 
#> downloads with chosen filename

lastversion https://transmissionbt.com/
#> 3.0
```

## Installation for CentOS/RHEL 7, 8 or Amazon Linux 2

```bash
sudo yum -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-latest.rpm
sudo yum -y install lastversion
```
   
## Installation for other systems

Installing with `pip` is easiest:

```bash
pip install lastversion
```
    
## Usage

Typically, you would just pass a repository URL (or repo owner/name to it) as the only argument, 
e.g.:

```bash
lastversion https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools
```

Equivalently accepted invocation with same output is:

```bash
lastversion gperftools/gperftools
```    

If you're lazy to even copy paste a project's URL, you can just type its name as argument, which 
will use repository search API (slower).
Helps to answer what is the latest Linux version:

```bash
lastversion linux
```

Or wondering what is the latest version of WordPress? :

```bash
lastversion wordpress
```
   
A special value of `self` for the main argument, will lookup the last release of `lastversion` 
itself.

For more options to control output or behavior, see `--help` output:    

```
usage: lastversion [-h] [--pre] [--verbose] [-d [FILENAME]]
                   [--format {version,assets,source,json,tag}] [--assets]
                   [--source] [-gt VER] [-b MAJOR] [--only ONLY]
                   [--filter REGEX] [-su]
                   [--at {github,gitlab,bitbucket,pip,hg,sf,website-feed,local}]
                   [-y] [--version]
                   [action] <repo or URL>

Find the latest release from GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket.

positional arguments:
  action                Special action to run, e.g. download, install, test
  <repo or URL>         GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repository in format
                        owner/name or any URL that belongs to it

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pre                 Include pre-releases in potential versions
  --verbose             Will give you idea of what is happening under the hood
  -d [FILENAME], --download [FILENAME]
                        Download with custom filename
  --format {version,assets,source,json,tag}
                        Output format
  --assets              Returns assets download URLs for last release
  --source              Returns only source URL for last release
  -gt VER, --newer-than VER
                        Output only if last version is newer than given
                        version
  -b MAJOR, --major MAJOR, --branch MAJOR
                        Only consider releases of a specific major version,
                        e.g. 2.1.x
  --only ONLY           Only consider releases containing this text. Useful
                        for repos with multiple projects inside
  --filter REGEX        Filters --assets result by a regular expression
  -su, --shorter-urls   A tiny bit shorter URLs produced
  --at {github,gitlab,bitbucket,pip,hg,sf,website-feed,local}
                        If the repo argument is one word, specifies where to
                        look up the project. The default is via internal
                        lookup or GitHub Search
  -y, --assumeyes       Automatically answer yes for all questions
  --version             show program's version number and exit
```

The `--format` will affect what kind of information from the last release and in which format will
 be displayed, e.g.:

*   `version` is the default. Simply outputs well-formatted version number of the latest release
*   `assets` will output a newline-separated list of assets URLs (if any), otherwise link to
    sources archive
*   `source` will output link to source archive, no matter if the release has some assets added
*   `json` can be used by external Python modules or for debugging, it is dict/JSON output of an API
    call that satisfied last version checks
*   `tag` will emit just the latest release's tag name, which useful if you're constructing download
    URL yourself or need the tag name otherwise

An asset is a downloadable file that typically represents an executable, or otherwise 
"ready to launch" project. It's what you see filed under formal releases, and is usually a compiled 
(for specific platform), program.

Source files, are either tarballs or zipballs of sources for the source code of release. 

You can display either assets or source URLs of the latest release, by passing the corresponding
 `--format flag`, e.g. `--format source`

You also simply pass `--source` instead of `--format source`, and `--assets` instead of 
`--format assets`, as in:

```bash
lastversion --assets mautic/mautic 
#> https://github.com/mautic/mautic/archive/2.15.1/mautic-2.15.1.tar.gz
```

By default, `lastversion` filters output of `--assets` to be OS specific. Who needs `.exe` on Linux?

To override this behavior, you can use `--filter`, which has a regular expression as its argument.
To disable OS filtering, use `--filter .`, this will match everything.

You can naturally use `--filter` in place where you would use `grep`, e.g. 
`lastversion --assets --filter win REPO`

### Use case: How to download latest version of something

You can also use `lastversion` to download assets/sources for the latest release.

Download the most recent Mautic source release:

```bash
lastversion mautic/mautic --download 
```
    
Customize downloaded filename (works only for sources, which is the default):

```bash
lastversion mautic/mautic --download mautic.tar.gz
```
    
Or you can just have `lastversion` output sources/assets URLs and have those downloaded by 
something else:    

```bash
wget $(lastversion --assets mautic/mautic)
```

This will download all assets of the newest stable Mautic, which are 2 zip files.

How this works: `lastversion` outputs all asset URLs, each on a new line, and `wget` is smart 
enough to download each URL. Magic :)

For releases which have no assets added, it will download source archive.  

To always download source, use `--source` instead:

```bash
wget $(lastversion --source mautic/mautic)  
```

### Use case: Get last version (betas are fine)

We consider latest release is the one which is stable / not marked as beta.
If you think otherwise, then pass `--pre` switch and if the latest version of repository is a 
pre-release, then you'll get its version instead:

```bash
lastversion --pre mautic/mautic 
#> 2.15.2b0
```
    
### Use case: version of a specific branch

For some projects, there may be several stable releases available simultaneously, in different
branches. An obvious example is PHP. You can use `--major` flag to specify the major release
version to match with, to help you find latest stable release of a branch, like so:

```bash
lastversion php/php-src --major 7.2
``` 

This will give you current stable version of PHP 7.2.x, e.g. `7.2.28`.

Branch selector is easy to be specified after semicolon, and together with the search API,
a clean invocation for the same would be:

```bash
lastversion php:7.2
```

The branch selector can also be used to get specific release details, e.g.:

```bash
lastversion php:7.2.33 --assets
```

#### Special use case: NGINX stable vs mainline branch version

```bash
lastversion https://nginx.org --major stable #> 1.16.1
lastversion https://nginx.org --major mainline #> 1.17.9
```
    
Behind the scenes, this checks with `hg.nginx.org` which is a Mercurial web repo.
Those are supported as well, e.g.

```bash
lastversion https://hg.example.com/project/
```
    
Mercurial repos are rather rare these days, but support has been added primarily for NGINX.

#### Special use case: find release of a PyPI project

Most Python libraries/apps are hosted on PyPI. To check versions of a project on PyPI, you can use:

```bash
lastversion https://pypi.org/project/requests/
```

If you prefer using shorter repo name, ensure `--at pip` switch, like so:

```bash
lastversion requests --at pip
```

### Install an RPM asset

If a project provides `.rpm` assets and your system has `yum` or `dnf`, you can install the project's
 RPM directly, like so:

```bash
sudo lastversion install mailspring
```
 
This finds [MailSpring](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring), gets its latest release info, 
filters assets for `.rpm` and passes it to `yum` / `dnf`. 

You can even set up an auto-updater cron job which will ensure you are on the latest version of a
 package, like so:
 
```bash
@daily /usr/bin/lastversion install mailspring -y 2>/dev/null
```

If the Mailspring GitHub repo posts a release with newer `.rpm`, then it will be automatically
 installed, making sure you are running the latest and greated Mailspring version.
  
You'll even get an email alert after update (standard cron feature).

Needless to say, more often than not such RPM packages have no idea about all potentially missing
dependencies. Thus, only use `lastversion install ...` if the software is missing from the base
`yum` repositories.

### Test version parser

The `test` command can be used for troubleshooting or simply well formatting a string with version:

```bash
lastversion test 'blah-1.2.3-devel' # > 1.2.3.dev0
lastversion test '1.2.x' # > False (no clear version)
lastversion test '1.2.3-rc1' # > 1.2.3rc1
```

### Scripting with `lastversion` in `bash`

#### Check for NEW release

When you're building some upstream package, and you did this before, there is a known "last build" 
version.
Automatic builds become easy with:

```bash
CURRENTLY_BUILT_VER=1.2.3 # stored somewhere, e.g. spec file in my case
LASTVER=$(lastversion repo/owner -gt ${CURRENTLY_BUILT_VER})
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
  # LASTVER is newer, update and trigger build
  # ....
fi
```

Here, the `-gt` is actually a switch passed to `lastversion`, which acts in a similar fashion to
 `-gt` comparison in bash.

There is more to it, if you want to make this reliable.
See my ranting on 
[RPM auto-builds with `lastversion`](https://github.com/dvershinin/lastversion/wiki/Use-in-RPM-building)

#### Check if there is a newer kernel for your Linux machine

```bash
LATEST_KERNEL=$(lastversion linux -gt $(uname -r | cut -d '-' -f 1))
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "I better update my kernel now, because ${LATEST_KERNEL} is there"
else 
  echo "My kernel is latest and greatest."
fi 
```  

#### Exit Status codes

Exit status codes are the usual means of communicating a command's execution success or failure. 
So `lastversion` follows this: successful command returns `0` while anything else is an error of 
some kind:
 
Exit status code `1` is returned for cases like no release tag existing for repository at all, or 
repository does not exist.

Exit status code `2` is returned for `-gt` version comparison negative lookup.

Exit status code `3` is returned when filtering assets of last release yields empty URL set 
(no match)

## Tips

Getting latest version is heavy on the API, because GitHub does not allow to fetch tags in 
chronological order, and some repositories switch from one version format to another, so *we can't 
just consider highest version to be latest*.
We have to fetch every tag's commit date, and see if it's actually more recent. Thus it's slower
with larger repositories, which have potentially a lot of tags.

Thus, `lastversion` makes use of caching API response to be fast and light on GitHub API,
It does conditional ETag validation, which, as per GitHub API will not count towards rate limit.
The cache is stored in `~/.cache/lastversion` on Linux systems.

It is *much recommended* to set up your [GitHub API token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
Bare API token is enough, you may deselect all permissions. 
You can then increase your rate limit by adding the following `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can use either `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
The former has priority.
    
For GitLab, you can use a
[Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html):

```bash
export GITLAB_PA_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then run `source ~/.bashrc`. After this, `lastversion` will use it to get larger API calls allowance
from GitHub.

## Usage in a Python module

You can use `lastversion.has_update(...)` to find whether an update for existing version of
 something is available, simply:

```python
from lastversion import lastversion
latest_version = lastversion.has_update(repo="mautic/mautic", current_version='1.2.3')
if latest_version:
    print('Newer Mautic version is available: {}'.format(str(latest_version)))
else:
    print('No update is available')
```

The `lastversion.has_update(...)` function accepts any URL from a repository (or its short name
, e.g. `owner/name`) and you should pass existing/current version.

If you are checking version of a project on PyPi, supply an additional `at='pip'` argument,
in order to avoid passing the full PyPI URI of a project, and remove ambiguity with GitHub hosted
 projects. For example, checking for newer Requests
library:

```python
from lastversion import lastversion
latest_version = lastversion.has_update(repo="requests", at='pip', current_version='1.2.3')
if latest_version:
    print('Newer Requests library is available: {}'.format(str(latest_version)))
else:
    print('No update is available')
```

The `has_update` function returns either:

*   The [Version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.Version) object
*   `False` if there is no newer version than the one given

Alternatively, invoke `lastversion.latest(...)` function to get the latest version information
 for a repo.  
 
```python
from lastversion import lastversion
from packaging import version

latest_mautic_version = lastversion.latest("mautic/mautic", output_format='version', pre_ok=True)

print('Latest Mautic version: {}'.format(str(latest_mautic_version)))

if latest_mautic_version >= version.parse('1.8.1'):
    print('It is newer')
```

With `output_format='version'` (the default), the function returns a 
[Version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.Version) object, or
 `None`. So you can do things like above, namely version comparison, checking dev status, etc.
 
With `output_format='dict'`, a dictionary returned with latest release information, or `False`.
The dictionary keys vary between different project locations (GitHub vs BitBucket, for example),
but are guaranteed to always have these keys:

*   `version`: [Version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.Version) 
 object, contains the found release version, e.g. `1.2.3`
*   `source`: string, identifier of the project source, e.g. `github`, or `gitlab`
*   `tag_date`: datetime object, the release date, e.g. `2020-12-15 14:41:39`
*   `from`: string, contains fully qualified URL of the project
*   `tag_name`: string, version control tag name corresponding to the release

The `lastversion.latest` function accepts 3 arguments

*   `repo`, in format of `<owner>/<name>`, or any URL under this repository, e.g. `https://github.com/dvershinin/lastversion/issues`   
*   `format`, which accepts same values as when you run `lastversion` interactively, as well as
 `dict` to return an dictionary as described above
*   `pre_ok`, boolean for whether to include pre-releases as potential versions
*   `at`, specifies project location when using one-word repo names, one of 
 `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, `pip`, `hg`, `sf`, `website-feed`, `local`
