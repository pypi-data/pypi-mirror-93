<p> This application is written in Python,
    with the help of the <a href="https://www.reportlab.com">ReportLab</a> library
    (the web part is powered by the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> framework).
    The code is open-source
    and is available here: <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>.
    The ability of this application to reproduce several figures (independently) published by the IPCC was
    carefully tested. However, this is not a product of the IPCC (which is
    not responsible for projects or researches).

We are sorry to hear that you have encountered a problem. We will do everything we can to help. Please have a look at

feedback.

<h1 class="nondoc">Development history</h1>
<p>
    Although the web application and layout details were improved over time, there is no change affecting the translation
    of the risk levels provided as input to colours in the burning embers. The changes are recorded on
    <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>
    (see <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a>).
    A short summary is provided below (from recent to old).
</p>

<h2>Recent news?</h2>
<p> When an update is planned, it might be announced on  <a href="https://climrisk.org">climrisk.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>2021/01: Additional layout options.</h2>
<p> Optional secondary axis (on the right, typically with a different scale), minor tick marks
    (unlabelled ticks between the main axis ticks), tick marks instead of horizontal grid lines, legend for confidence
    levels (experimental).
    <br> (version 1.5)
</p>

<h2>2020/12: Improvements, full documentation of the parameters, bug fix for specific cases.</h2>
<p> File format download options (PDF/PNG/JPEG) are added. Cases where the vertical scale ('hazard') has limits significantly
    different from the usual "0 to +5Â°C", such as for CO2 concentrations in ppm, are now much better handled (bug fix).
    Coding improvements provide more clarity for future development. All parameters are documented in a way
    that is fully consistent with how they work (the same file provides online documentation and default values).
    <br> (version 1.4)
</p>

<h2>2020/08: Median value in the transitions and better handling of input file issues</h2>
<p> An optinal median, or 'midpoint' between the start and end of each transition, is added in the 'Basic format'.
This results in the 'standard template' provided in <a href="{{ url_for('.doc',subpage='tutorial')}}">Tutorial</a>.
    Input files containing missing data, errors, or other unexpected characteristics are better handled.</p>

<h2>2019/11 - 2020/05: Initial development</h2>
<p> This software was created by Philippe Marbaix at the end of 2019
    (based on an earlier 'AR5-related' back-of-the-envelope version).
    The first objective was to produce figure 3 of Zommers et al. (2020;
    <i>Burning Embers: Towards more transparent and robust climate change risk assessments</i>.
    Nature Reviews Earth & Environment. <a href="https://doi.org/10/gg985p">doi.org/10/gg985p</a>).<br>
</p>
<p> Help is welcome to further improve the application. All contributions will be recognised :-).
