# Overview

Vectrix is a platform and marketplace that allows security teams and companies to easily bootstrap their detection and response capabilities across their cloud environments and third-party services in minutes.

This is possible thanks to Vectrix Modules, the individual, automated scripts and tools that are used to scan for a predetermined security issue, risk, or misconfiguration.

Modules found on the Vectrix Marketplace are created by security engineers and developers through a development process managed by the Vectrix team. Development includes writing the scan logic that enables a module to detect (and often remediate) when an issue is identified.

# Details

This is our Python 3 SDK for creating vectrix modules. For more information on creating a module yourself, please visit: https://developer.vectrix.io

# Installation

- pip3 install vectrix
