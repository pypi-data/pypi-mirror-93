## How to install

### Basic

Install `boto3-stubs`, to add type annotations for `boto3` package.

```bash
# install type annotations just for boto3
python -m pip install boto3-stubs

# install `boto3` type annotations
# for ec2, s3, rds, lambda, sqs, dynamo and cloudformation
# Consumes ~7 MB of space
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[essential]'

# or install annotations for services you use
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[acm,apigateway]'
```

## How to uninstall

```bash
# uninstall boto3-stubs
python -m pip uninstall -y boto3-stubs

# uninstall submodules
python -m pip freeze | grep mypy-boto3 | xargs python -m pip uninstall -y
```

## Usage

### VSCode

- Install [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- Install [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- Set `Pylance` as your Python Language Server
- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`

Both type checking and auto-complete should work for installed `boto3` services.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

### PyCharm

- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Install `mypy_boto3_builder`: `pip install mypy_boto3_builder`
- Generate stubs in `<project_root>/typings` directory for services you use

```bash
python -m mypy_boto3_builder --installed --skip-services typings -d -s s3 ec2
```

- Add `<project_root>/typings` folder to your [Interpreter Paths](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/stubs.html#reuse-stubs)

Since stubs are stored in your project root, you do not need to re-generate them after update.

### Emacs

- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Install
  [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package),
  [lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/),
  [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) and
  [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) packages
- Install [lsp-pyright](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright) package

```elisp
(use-package lsp-pyright
  :ensure t
  :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                          (require 'lsp-pyright)
                          (lsp)))  ; or lsp-deferred
  :init (when (executable-find "python3")
          (setq lsp-pyright-python-executable-cmd "python3"))
  )
```

- Make sure emacs uses the environment where you have installed `boto3-stubs`

### Sublime Text

- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Install [LSP-pyright](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-pyright) package
- Make sure emacs uses the environment where you have installed `boto3-stubs`

### Other IDEs

Not tested, but as long as your IDE support `mypy` or `pyright`, everything should work.

### mypy

- Install `mypy`: `python -m pip install mypy`
- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Run `mypy` as usual

Type checking should work for installed `boto3` services.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

### pyright

- Install `pyright`: `yarn global add pyright`
- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Optionally, you can install `boto3-stubs` to `typings` folder.

Type checking should work for installed `boto3` services.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

### Explicit type annotations

To speed up type checking and auto-complete, you can set types explicitly.

```python
import boto3
from boto3.session import Session

import mypy_boto3_ec2.client import EC2Client
import mypy_boto3_ec2.service_resource import EC2ServiceResource
import mypy_boto3_ec2.waiter import BundleTaskCompleteWaiter
import mypy_boto3_ec2.paginator import DescribeVolumesPaginator

session = Session(region_name="us-west-1")

ec2_client: EC2Client = boto3.client("ec2", region_name="us-west-1")
ec2_resource: EC2ServiceResource = session.resource("ec2")

bundle_task_complete_waiter: BundleTaskCompleteWaiter = ec2_client.get_waiter("bundle_task_complete")
describe_volumes_paginator: DescribeVolumesPaginator = ec2_client.get_paginator("describe_volumes")
```

### Pylint compatibility

It is totally safe to use `TYPE_CHECKING` flag in order to avoid `boto3-stubs`
dependency in production.
However, there is an issue in `pylint` that it complains about undefined
variables. To fix it, set all types to `object` in non-`TYPE_CHECKING` mode.

```python
import boto3
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from mypy_boto3_ec2 import EC2Client, EC2ServiceResource
    from mypy_boto3_ec2.waiters import BundleTaskCompleteWaiter
    from mypy_boto3_ec2.paginators import DescribeVolumesPaginator
else:
    EC2Client = object
    EC2ServiceResource = object
    BundleTaskCompleteWaiter = object
    DescribeVolumesPaginator = object

...
```

## How it works

Fully automated [mypy-boto3-builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder) carefully generates
type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
  extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
  and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for readability.
