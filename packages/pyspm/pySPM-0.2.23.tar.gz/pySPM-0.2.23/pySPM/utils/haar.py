    This code was inspired from: https://github.com/spacetelescope/sprint_notebooks/blob/master/lucy_damped_haar.ipynb
    I believe it was initially written by Justin Ely: https://github.com/justincely
    It was buggy and not working properly with every image sizes.
    I have thus exchanged it by using pyWavelet (pywt) and a custom function htrans
    to calculate the matrix for the var_image.
