5.0 2020-07-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a storage backend framework, including S3 and Swift backends.

* Changed configuration file format due to new storage backends:
  - renamed `backend` parameter to `database` in `archive` section
  - added `storage` parameter to `archive` section
  - added new sections for `fs`, `s3`, and 'swift`
  - moved `root` and `use_symlinks` parameters from `archive` section
    to `fs` section
  - added `tmp_root` parameter to `s3` and `swift` sections

* Added support for pg8000 as postgresql driver. Added 'library'
  parameter to 'postgresql' section to specify library to use.

* Added a basic test/coverage framework.

* Changed the syntax for defining namespace properties, allowing
  one to specify if a property should be indexed in the database backend.
  The old approach is still supported for backward compatibility.

* Added -c/--catalogue-only option to muninn-remove.

* Added support for sub-queries in is_source_of and is_derived_from
  (specify a sub-query instead of a uuid).

* Added support for searching on UUID directly (without uuid==).

* Several fixes for NOT expressions in queries.

* Improved querying on NULL properties. For example, for 'property != b',
  we now also return products for which b is NULL.

* Added property_names argument to archive.retrieve_properties().

* Added archive.delete_properties().

* Fixed issue with intra-archive symlinks without enclosing dir (resulting
  in broken symlinks).

* Fixed issue where product hashes were not actually verified.

* Made product hashing compatible with Python 3 (and using UTF-8 encoding
  before hashing, instead of the current filesystem encoding).

4.4 2019-04-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added optional progress bars to muninn-ingest (requires 'tqdm' package).

* Added --parallel and --processes options to muninn-ingest.

* Added --processes option to muninn-update.

* Added property_names argument to archive.search().

* Cleaned up terminology: we now use 'properties' instead of 'attributes'
  everywhere when refering to product metadata.

* Fixed issue in sqlite backend where geometry covers()/intersects()
  operations returned true if geometry property was not defined.

4.3 2018-10-04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added muninn-summary to display aggregate statistics.

* Removed muninn-search '-s' option in favor of muninn-summary.

* Fixed initialization of database when using sqlite backend.

* Strip operation now automatically restricts itself to products with a
  non-empty archive_path.

4.2 2018-06-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added -f/--force option to muninn-ingest.

* Improved formatting of duration in muninn-search summary output.

* Added optional progress bars to muninn-update (requires 'tqdm' package).

* Added --parallel and --keep options to muninn-update.

* Several fixes for muninn-search --paths.

* Archive.export() now returns the list of paths of the exported products. The
  `export_` functions in the product type plugins must return the path of the
  exported product.

* Fixed issue where the database connection was not properly cleaned up when
  an error was raised during a database commit/rollback.

* Fixed issue where muninn-prepare --dryrun would not produce output for
  sqlite if the database file did not exist yet.

* Fixed issue where 'active' state was not always reset when a muninn-pull
  failed.

* Improve handling of creating tags/links that already exist
  (postgresql will now only raise an exception for contention cases).

* Added check on startup to verify that all mandatory attributes/methods are
  available for each product type plugin.

* Several smaller fixes (including Python3 compatibility).

4.1 2017-11-16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added support for Python 3.

* Dropped support for spatialite 3.1 and earlier. spatialite 4.0.0 or higher
  is now required (which requires a version of sqlite3 that support
  extensions). Support for pyspatialite, which only worked with spatialite
  3.1, has been dropped. pysqlite2 is now the preferred module for sqlite
  support.

* Muninn now supports custom remote backends (used for muninn-pull).
  The ecmwfapi pull support has now been removed from the core muninn code and
  will become available as a separate plugin.

* Added muninn-info to display generic archive information (currently, the
  availables namespaces and product types)

* Added archive maintenance tool muninn-update that allows updating properties
  for a set of products (for when e.g. a product type plugin has changed).

* Added mod_spatialite_path option for sqlite backend.

* Command line tools now have a --verbose mode, displaying debug-level logging.

* Added 'paths' option to muninn-search that prints the physical path of the
  products found instead of the normal output.

* Added --keep option to muninn-ingest to ingest products that are already in
  the archive, maintaining its current relative path.

* Allow calling `muninn-search -p '*'` to fetch all fields of all namespaces.

* muninn.Archive.product_path() argument can be a product properties Struct.

* Added support for tabulate package to format the output.

* muninn.Archive.update_properties() takes an optional 'create_namespaces'
  parameter that, if set, will create any undefined namespaces for a product.

* Added product plugin method 'post_pull_hook' that is called after a
  successful pull.

* Close SQL connection after each operation (ingestion/search/etc.).

* Added support for separate auth_file that can contain credentials for
  downloads performed using muninn-pull.

* Added -f option to muninn-strip.

* Fixed issue where geometry columns in namespace extensions were not
  created when using the sqlite backend.

4.0 2017-03-31
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed license of muninn to BSD.

* Muninn can now be used as a pure catalogue server.
  An archive root directory is still needed, but can remain empty.

* Changed the core schema:
  - core.archive_date is now optional and is only set if core.archive_path is
    set.
    It will reflect the time at which the product was stored in the archive.
  - added core.metadata_date which represents the last modification time of
    the metadata record. It will automatically be updated if the metadata is
    changed via the muninn interfaces.
  - added optional core.remote_url field which can contain urls of the form
    file://, http://, ftp://, etc. that point to a remote location of the
    product.

* The schema_name option for the postgresql backend has been removed.
  This is now replaced by a table_prefix option that is applicable for
  both the postgresql and sqlite backends.

* The sqlite backend will no longer remove the database file for a 'destroy'
  (it will only remove the tables). Both 'prepare' and 'destroy' can be
  performed on an existing sqlite database file.

* Added 'pull' command that allows downloading of products that are not yet
  in the archive. It will use the core.remote_url value to perform the
  download. A 'retrieve' still only works on products that are already in the
  archive.
  The pull method supports the default http/https/file/ftp protocols but also
  supports a custom ecmwfapi protocol that will use the ecmwf-api-client
  python package to download data from the ECMWF MARS archive.

* The muninn Struct type that is used in the Python interface to store
  metadata can now be initialized with a Python dict.

* Added create_properties() and generate_uuid() functions to the Python
  muninn.Archive interface. These are functions that should be used to create
  pure metadata records (without archived product) in a muninn archive.

* Added verify_hash() function to the Python muninn.Archive interface.

* muninn.Archive.generate_uuid() is now a static method.

* Improved preparing and destroying of muninn archives. This will now better
  distinguish between the archive directory and the catalogue.

* Verifying of the hash after an ingest of a product in the archive is now
  optional (--verify-hash argument to muninn-ingest).

* The muninn sqlite backend now adds a spatialindex on footprint.
  The indices for both backends have all been renamed to idx_<table>_<field>.

* muninn-prepare has a --dry-run mode, that just dumps the SQL that would be
  executed.

* The muninn sqlite backend now supports the escape character '\' when using
  the ~= operator.

* Moved change history from README to separate CHANGELOG file.
  Renamed README.developer to EXTENSIONS and added DEVELOPER file.
  Include all documentation files with the source package.

3.0.1 2016-09-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed parsing of negative coordinates in literal geometry values.

3.0 2016-03-29
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added sqlite backend.

* Added arithmetic operators "+", "-", "*", and "/" for all numeric types.

* Added binary "-" operator for timestamps. This operator returns the length
  of the time interval between two timestamps as a fractional number of
  seconds.

* Updated comparison operators to support comparisons between integer and real
  types.

* Changed the muninn expression language to use a sub-set of the Well Known
  Text (WKT) markup language to represent literal geometry values.

* Added -c/--catalogue-only arguments to prepare/destroy commands to only
  create/remove the catalogue database (while keeping the product archive
  intact).

* If a product that is ingested is already in the right target location in
  the archive on disk, muninn will just leave the product at its location
  without trying to move or symlink it.

* Added 'id' primary key to links and tags tables, which is to support other
  front-ends (which don't support multi-field primary keys) on top of the
  same muninn database.
  This change should not require a migration of existing databases (as long
  as no other front-ends are planned to be used).

* Tags no longer have the constraint that they should be an 'identifier'.
  Added ',' as tag separator to output of muninn-list-tags.

* Changed the Postgresql backend to create indices on most columns of the
  'core', 'tag', and 'link' tables when creating these tables.

* MUNINN_CONFIG_PATH can now also refer directly to archive configuration
  files.

2.0.1 2015-11-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed the tag() function of the Archive class such that setting a tag on
  a product that already has that tag is not treated as an error.

* Changed the link() function of the Archive class such that adding a link
  to a product that already has that link is not treated as an error.

* Changed the tags() function of the Archive class to return a list of tags
  ordered by tag name.

* Improved error reporting for errors related to the creation or destruction
  of an archive.

* Improved error reporting by the Postgresql backend.

2.0 2015-09-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Renamed property core.logical_name to core.product_name.

* Which namespaces and product types are available is now configured per
  archive (in the archive configuration file) instead of globally.

* Extensions have been split into two types: namespace extensions (that
  contain namespace definitions) and product type extensions (that contain
  product type plug-ins). Extensions no longer have to contain both.

* Extensions should now be reachable via the PYTHONPATH, the
  MUNINN_EXTENSION_PATH is no longer in use.

* Added core.size property to contain the product size on disk (in bytes).
  When a product is ingested, the size of the product will be computed and
  stored automatically.

* Added a count option to muninn-search that prints the number of products
  found instead of the normal output.

* Added a summary options to muninn-search that prints a short summary of the
  products found instead of the normal output.

* Changed the retrieve(), export(), remove() and strip() functions of the
  Archive class to return the number of affected products.

* Added convenience functions for the retrieve(), export(), remove() and
  strip() functions of the Archive class that perform the desired function
  given a uuid or product name instead of a muninn expression.

* Added the product_path() function to the Archive class that returns the path
  to a product given a uuid or product name.

* Added the root() function to the Archive class that returns the archive root
  path.

* Removed @property decorators from functions of the Archive class.

* Removed dependency on importlib and added compatibility for older versions
  of psycopg (>=2.0) and Python (>=2.6).

* Added documentation for muninn extension developers (see README.developer).

1.3.2 2015-06-23
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed functions that operate on product data, i.e. export(), retrieve(),
  remove(), strip(), and rebuild_properties() to raise an exception when
  called on a partially ingested product (of which the core.active property
  equals false).

* Added a "force" keyword argument to the remove() function that enables the
  removal of partially ingested products.

* Added a -f/--force option to the muninn-remove tool that enables the removal
  of partially ingested products.

* Applied minor correction to update instructions for version 1.3.

1.3.1 2015-05-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added instructions for upgrading existing archives created with a prior
  version of muninn to version 1.3.

* Fixed issue in product catalogue rebuild functionality related to the
  plug-in API change introduced in version 1.3.

* Reverted changes to exception messages generated by the Postgres backend.

1.3 2015-05-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added support for product tags
  - Added muninn-tag, muninn-untag, and muninn-list-tags tools to manage
    product tags from the command line.
  - Added a -T/--tag option to the muninn-ingest tool and the ingest
    function of the xml-pi tool.
  - Added a has_tag() function that can be used in query expressions to
    select products that have been tagged with the specified tag.
  - Changed the muninn plug-in API: The analyze() function should return
    a tuple or list of two elements: The product properties and a list of
    product tags. To ensure backward compatibility, if a plug-in returns
    an instance of muninn.Struct, this is used as the product properties,
    and the product tags default to the empty list. New plug-in
    implementations should conform to the updated API.

* Changes to the query expression language:
  - Added support for \timestamps that only contain a date, e.g.
    "2012-01-01".
  - For properties from the core namespace, the "core." prefix may now be
    omitted, e.g. "uuid" is equivalent to "core.uuid".
  - The is_source_of() and is_derived_from() functions have been changed
    from two argument (binary) to single argument (unary) functions. The
    left-hand side is assumed to be the product being searched for, i.e.
    is_derived_from(uuid) matches all product that are derived from
    the product with the specified uuid.

* Added support for more than one export format per product type. See also the
  new -f/--format option of the muninn-export tool.

1.2.1 2015-04-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed race condition that caused failures when several clients tried to
  ingest products that shared the same archive path.

* Fixed race condition that could cause failures when several clients try to
  remove the same product(s).

* Added -c/--copy option to muninn-ingest that forces ingestion of a copy of
  each product. The -l/--link option and -c/--copy option are mutually
  exclusive. If neither option is provided, the "use_symlinks" option from the
  archive configuration file controls wether products will be ingested as
  symlinks or as copies.

1.2 2015-04-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed muninn-remove to always remove products from disk as well as from
  the product catalogue.

* Added muninn-strip tool that removes products from disk but not from the
  product catalogue.

* Added -d/--directory option to muninn-retrieve and muninn-export that
  controls the directory where the retrieved/exported products will be stored.

* Changed muninn-search multi-valued arguments (-o and -p) such that these
  options can be specified multiple times, and a white space separated list of
  values can be provided. This avoids the use of "--".

* Several minor changes:
  - Changed muninn-search to output all properties of the core namespace
    when no properties are specified using "-p".
  - Minor tweak to the output of muninn-search to improve readability of
    empty values at the beginning or end of a line.
  - Improved error messages produced by expression lexer/parser.

1.1 2015-03-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed issue where failure during product ingestion could lead to stale
  entries in the product catalogue with the "core.active" property set to
  false.

* Changed ingest and remove operations to use temporary directories located
  inside the product archive itself instead of using separate temporary
  directory. Using a separate directory caused issues if it resided on a
  different mount point than the product archive.
  - NB. As a result of this change, the product archive is located
    directly under the archive root path specified in the configuration
    file. The intermediate "data" and "tmp" directories no longer exist.

* Create relative links when ingesting (using symbolic links) a product that
  consists of one or more files or products that already reside inside the
  archive. This ensures the archive as a whole can be relocated without
  breaking intra-archive symbolic links.

* Improvements to avoid idle database connections:
  - Added support for explicitly closing an archive when it is no longer
    needed.
  - Changed the Postgres backend to defer connecting to the database until
    a connection is required.

* Removed support for verifying product hash when retrieving or exporting a
  product.
  - NB. As a consequence the "verify_hash_on_retrieve" archive
    configuration option was removed as well.

* Added API support for updating (re-extracting) the properties of archived
  products.

* Added API support for manipulating product properties.

* Changed extension loading to skip paths in the MUNINN_EXTENSIONS_PATH that
  do not exist.

* Fixed issue where sections of a search expression that could not be
  tokenized were silently ignored.

* Changed parser to ignore white space at the end of a search expression.

* Improved documentation.

1.0 2014-08-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First official release of muninn.
