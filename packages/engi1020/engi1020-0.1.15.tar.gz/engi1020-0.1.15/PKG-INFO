Description: =======================================
        engi1020: Engineering 1020 library
        =======================================
        
        This library wraps several other libraries and re-exports them.
        This makes for a messy namespace, but that simplifies the business of importing
        libraries for very new students, as they only need to write
        
        ::
            from engi1020 import *
        
        The libraries (re-)imported by this library are:
        
        https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html[`matplotlib.pyplot`]
          A plotting library using a MATLAB-like API
        
        https://pypi.org/project/nanpy[`nanpy`]
          A Python library for interacting with an Arduino board
