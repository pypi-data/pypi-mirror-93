        Overview
        --------
        
        This is a plugin for the Open edX Platform that provides the Course Access
        Group functionality. It can be installed via pip with minimal configuration to
        provide an admin panel to allow site administrators to create access groups
        and assign courses to them.
        
        Learners upon registration will be automatically
        assigned to a specific group, from which it'll be possible to see which
        courses they'll be able to see and enroll in.
        
        The classic example is that you'd want to offer different courses to your
        ``customers``, ``employees`` and offer some courses for everyone. Hence you'd
        need to make two groups and assign courses to only learners within those
        groups while mark some courses as public ones.

        --------------------------
        
        The bad news, there's none. The good news is that there's a plan to make it
        work with the upstream Open edX versions out of the box.
        
        The even better news, is that you can get this plugin to work by
        cherry-picking the following pull requests:
        
         * The `Access Control Backends pull request`_.
         * The `USER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED signal`_.
         * The `edx-search integration with the "has_access" function`_.
