    Fixes an issue where multiple NTP daemons could be running on the overcloud
    hosts, due to Kolla Ansible deploying a chrony container by default
    starting with the Rocky release.

    Kayobe now overrides this default, to ensure that chrony does not conflict
    with the NTP daemon deployed on the host. To use the containerised chrony
    daemon instead, set ``kolla_enable_chrony`` to ``true`` in
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/kolla.yml``. This will also disable the host NTP
    daemon.

    To ensure that chrony is not running, Kayobe removes the chrony container
    if ``kolla_enable_chrony`` is ``false`` in the following commands:

    * ``kayobe overcloud service deploy``
    * ``kayobe overcloud service reconfigure``
    * ``kayobe overcloud service upgrade``

    The play in Kayobe is tagged with ``stop-chrony``.
