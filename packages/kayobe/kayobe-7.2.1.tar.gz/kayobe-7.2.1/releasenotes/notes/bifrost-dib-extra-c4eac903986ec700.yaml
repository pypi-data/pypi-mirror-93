    Adds new variables, ``kolla_bifrost_dib_elements_extra`` and
    ``kolla_bifrost_dib_env_vars_extra``, in
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/bifrost.yml`` for setting additional
    ``diskimage-builder`` elements and environment variables for the disk image
    generated by Bifrost. Default elements and environment variables are now
    respectively defined by ``kolla_bifrost_dib_elements_default`` and
    ``kolla_bifrost_dib_env_vars_default``.
upgrade:
  - |
    It is now possible to set additional ``diskimage-builder`` elements and
    environment variables for the disk image generated by Bifrost, while
    keeping defaults set by Kayobe. If your configuration overrides
    ``kolla_bifrost_dib_elements`` or ``kolla_bifrost_dib_env_vars`` while
    still including default values set in ``ansible/group_vars/all/bifrost``,
    you can move your additions to ``kolla_bifrost_dib_elements_extra`` and
    ``kolla_bifrost_dib_env_vars_extra`` instead.
