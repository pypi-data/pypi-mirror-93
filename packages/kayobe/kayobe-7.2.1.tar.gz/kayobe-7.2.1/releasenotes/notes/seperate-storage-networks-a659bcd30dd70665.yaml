    Add support for separate storage networks for both Ceph and Swift.
    This adds four additional networks, which can be used to separate the storage
    network traffic as follows:

    * Ceph storage network (ceph_storage_net_name) is used to carry Ceph storage
      data traffic. Defaults to the storage network (storage_net_name).
    * Ceph storage management network (ceph_storage_mgmt_net_name) is used to carry
      storage management traffic. Defaults to the storage management network
      (storage_mgmt_net_name).
    * Swift storage network (swift_storage_net_name) is used to carry Swift storage data
      traffic. Defaults to the storage network (storage_net_name).
    * Swift storage replication network (swift_storage_replication_net_name) is used to
      carry storage management traffic. Defaults to the storage management network
      (storage_mgmt_net_name).
