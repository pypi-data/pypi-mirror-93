    Adds support for the ``defroute`` network attribute. This attribute can be
    used to disable configuration of the default gateway by a specific
    interface. This is particularly useful to ignore a gateway address provided
    via DHCP. Note that this attribute is only supported on distributions of
    the Red Hat family.
