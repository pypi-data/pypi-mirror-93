    Adds support for configuring software RAID arrays using ``mdadm``. Software
    RAID configuration is applied before LVM configuration, which allows
    creating LVM volumes on top of software RAID arrays. See `story 2005017
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005017>`__ for details.
