    Fixes an issue when configuring the external API network interface on
    controllers without an IP address which would cause ``kayobe overcloud host
    configure`` to fail on a host with an active virtual IP address.  See
    `story 2007736 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007736>`__ for
    details.
