    Support for configuring an NTP daemon on the seed and overcloud hosts is no
    longer present for CentOS 8, as appropriate packages are not available.
    Instead, Kolla Ansible is configured to deploy the ``chrony`` container on
    CentOS 8 overcloud hosts by default.  Note that for CentOS 8 during the
    Train release, the standard ``kolla_enable_chrony`` variable in
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/kolla.yml`` has no effect. Instead, chrony may be
    disabled by setting ``enable_chrony`` to ``false`` in
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/kolla/globals.yml``.
