upgrade:
  - |
    When enabled, a Docker Registry is now deployed on hosts in the
    ``docker-registry`` group, which defaults to include the seed. The existing
    behaviour of deploying on the first controller can be retained by removing
    the seed group from ``[docker-registry:children]`` in
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/inventory/groups`` and creating a
    ``[docker-registry]`` group including the name of the first controller.
  - |
    Modifies the default value of ``docker_registry_image`` variable to not use
    a private registry in the image name by default. This avoids a potential
    circular dependency during deployment of the registry container.
