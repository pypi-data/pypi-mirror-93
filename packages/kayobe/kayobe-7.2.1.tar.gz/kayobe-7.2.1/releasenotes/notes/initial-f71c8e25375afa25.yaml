features:
  - Adds support for configuration of custom repositories. ``yum_custom_repos``
    should be a dict of repositories.
  - Adds support for configuration of ``live-restore`` option in docker. This
    is enabled by setting the variable ``docker_daemon_live_restore``. The
    option is set to ``false`` by default.
  - Facilitates deployment of TLS certificate bundles in environments
    where SSL is required.  To use this feature, populate the contents
    of the variable ``kolla_tls_cert`` - this will then be copied in to
    place for use by HAProxy.
upgrade:
  - The reference to ``kolla_external_fqdn_cert`` has been removed in
    favour of the ``kolla_tls_cert`` option, which handles setting this
    on the user's behalf.
