    Adds support for configuring LVM volume groups on the seed hypervisor.
    Setting the ``seed_hypervisor_lvm_groups`` variable in
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/seed-hypervisor.yml`` to
    ``"{{ seed_hypervisor_lvm_groups_with_data }}"`` and providing a list of
    storage devices via the ``seed_hypervisor_lvm_group_data_disks`` variable
    will configure a logical volume mounted to ``/var/lib/libvirt/images``. No
    LVM volume groups are configured by default.
