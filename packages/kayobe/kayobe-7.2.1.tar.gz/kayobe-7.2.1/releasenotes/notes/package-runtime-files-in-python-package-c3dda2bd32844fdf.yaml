    Kayobe no longer requires a checkout of the source code repository to
    function. The files needed to run kayobe are now shipped as part of the
    python package. Please see: `Story 2004252 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004252/>`_
    for more details.
upgrade:
  - |
    Modifications to the kayobe source tree will no longer have an immediate
    effect. This is because the ansible playbooks are now shipped as part of the
    kayobe package. You must reinstall the package, or use an editable package
    install, see: `pip editable-installs
    <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`_,
    to replicate the old behaviour.
