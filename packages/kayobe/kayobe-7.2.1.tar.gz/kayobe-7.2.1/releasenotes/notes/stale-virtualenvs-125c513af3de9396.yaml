features:
  - |
    Adds a new configuration variable, ``pip_upper_constraints_file``, which is
    used to configure the file or URL containing the python upper version
    contraints. Its default value is
    ``https://releases.openstack.org/constraints/upper/{{ openstack_release }}``.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue with virtual environments on remote hosts, which may over
    the course of time become stale and incompatible with Kayobe or other
    software. This was fixed by installing the latest version of packages
    allowed by OpenStack upper constraints. See `story 2005923
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005923>`__ for details.
