    Adds support for configuration of the user used by Kolla Ansible for remote
    execution. The user is configured via ``kolla_ansible_user``, its primary
    group via ``kolla_ansible_group``, and ``kolla_ansible_become`` determines
    whether privilege escalation is used by Kolla Ansible for all tasks or only
    required tasks.
