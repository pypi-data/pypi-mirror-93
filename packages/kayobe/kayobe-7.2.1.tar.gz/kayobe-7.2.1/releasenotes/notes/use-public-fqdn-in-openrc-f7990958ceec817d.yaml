    The ``public-openrc.sh`` file generated by Kayobe now uses the public
    network FQDN for populating the OS_AUTH_URL variable instead of using the
    public virtual IP address. If the FQDN variable is not set, the virtual IP
    address remains used. This ensures better compatibility with TLS-enabled
    deployments where certificates are generally tied to a hostname.
