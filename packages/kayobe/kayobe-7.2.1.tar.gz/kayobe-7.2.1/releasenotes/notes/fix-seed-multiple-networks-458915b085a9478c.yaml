fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue with seed VMs with multiple network interfaces where
    interfaces could come up in a different order if the VM is recreated. The
    interfaces are now created in alphabetical order of their Kayobe network
    name by default. See `story 2007259
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007259>`__ for details.
features:
  - |
    Adds a ``seed_vm_interfaces`` variable which defines the network interfaces
    to which the seed VM is attached.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default order of network interfaces in the seed VM is now sorted
    alphabetically based on their Kayobe network name. This may require the
    seed's network interface names to be changed in configuration if the seed
    VM is recreated.  See `story 2007259
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007259>`__ for details.
