    Adds support for specifying a CA certificate when accessing APIs.  The path
    to the CA certificate may be specified via ``openstack_cacert`` , which
    takes its default value from the ``OS_CACERT`` environment variable.  See
    `story 2004911 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004911>`__ for
    details.
