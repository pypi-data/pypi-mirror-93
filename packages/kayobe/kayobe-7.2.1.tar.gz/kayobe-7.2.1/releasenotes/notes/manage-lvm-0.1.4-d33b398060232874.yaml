    The manage-lvm Ansible role was upgraded to version v0.1.4. If you are
    overriding variables to customize definitions of volume groups, you need to
    change the value of the ``disks`` parameter from a comma-separated string to a
    list. For example, change ``disks: "/dev/sda,/dev/sdb"`` to:

    .. code-block:: text

      disks:
        - "/dev/sda"
        - "/dev/sdb"
