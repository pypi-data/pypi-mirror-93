features:
  - |
    Adds support for a ``--disable-discovery`` argument to the ``kayobe
    physical network configure`` command. This can be used to configure the
    physical network after discovery of bare metal compute nodes is complete,
    to return the network to a normal state. The interface configuration to be
    applied is configured via ``switch_interface_config_disable_discovery``.
deprecations:
  - |
    The switch configuration variable ``switch_interface_config_discovery`` has
    been deprecated in favour of ``switch_interface_config_enable_discovery``.
    Support for ``switch_interface_config_discovery`` will be removed in the T*
    release.
