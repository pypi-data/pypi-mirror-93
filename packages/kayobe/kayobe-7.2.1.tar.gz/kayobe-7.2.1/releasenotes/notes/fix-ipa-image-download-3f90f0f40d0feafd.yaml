    It is now possible to specify a URL of a file containing a checksum of the
    Ironic Python Agent (IPA) images for the seed and overcloud Ironic and
    Ironic Inspector services. This allows Kayobe to detect changes in the
    image content and download as necessary. If specifying IPA images via URL,
    the checksums should be configured accordingly.

    The checksum URLs and algorithms are configured via these variables:

    * ``{{ ipa_kernel_checksum_url }}``
    * ``{{ ipa_kernel_checksum_algorithm }}``
    * ``{{ ipa_ramdisk_checksum_url }}``
    * ``{{ ipa_ramdisk_checksum_algorithm }}``

    For the seed this may be customised via these variables:

    * ``{{ kolla_bifrost_ipa_kernel_checksum_url }}``
    * ``{{ kolla_bifrost_ipa_kernel_checksum_algorithm }}``
    * ``{{ kolla_bifrost_ipa_ramdisk_checksum_url }}``
    * ``{{ kolla_bifrost_ipa_ramdisk_checksum_algorithm }}``

    For the overcloud Ironic Inspector service this may be customised via these
    variables:

    * ``{{ inspector_ipa_kernel_checksum_url }}``
    * ``{{ inspector_ipa_kernel_checksum_algorithm }}``
    * ``{{ inspector_ipa_ramdisk_checksum_url }}``
    * ``{{ inspector_ipa_ramdisk_checksum_algorithm }}``

    Fixes an issue with downloading Ironic Python Agent (IPA) images where new
    images would not be downloaded if the image had been downloaded previously.
