    The default IPA images now use CentOS as a base image. This is
    because CoreOS based images are no longer supported or built by
    the upstream Ironic Python Agent project as of the Train release.
    Please see the `Ironic Python Agent release notes
    <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-python-agent/train.html>`_
    for more details.
