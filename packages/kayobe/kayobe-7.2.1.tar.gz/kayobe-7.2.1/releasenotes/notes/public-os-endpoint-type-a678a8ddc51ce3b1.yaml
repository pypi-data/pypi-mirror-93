    Changes the value of ``OS_ENDPOINT_TYPE``, ``OS_MANILA_ENDPOINT_TYPE``, and
    ``OS_MISTRAL_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` in ``public-openrc.sh`` to use ``publicURL``,
    which should fix issues with legacy CLI tools on hosts without access to
    the internal API. See `story 2007950
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007950>`__ for details.
