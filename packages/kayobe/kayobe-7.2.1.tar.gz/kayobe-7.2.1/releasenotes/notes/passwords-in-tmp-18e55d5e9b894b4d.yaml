    Fixes an issue when generating the ``passwords.yml`` file for Kolla Ansible
    where if the contents of the file have not changed, a plain text copy of the
    file would be left in /tmp on the Ansible control host.

    The temporary files are typically named /tmp/tmpXXXXXX, and are owned by the
    user that runs kayobe, with permissions 664 (rw-rw-r--).

    It is recommended to check any systems on which Kayobe has been run for
    copies of the passwords file in /tmp. A simple check for this is `grep -rn
    database_password /tmp`.
