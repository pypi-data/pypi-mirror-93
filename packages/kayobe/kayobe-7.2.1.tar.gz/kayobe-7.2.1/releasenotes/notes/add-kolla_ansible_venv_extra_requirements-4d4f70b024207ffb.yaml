    Adds support for installing extra Python packages inside the kolla-ansible
    virtualenv, such as when required by Ansible plugins. A list of extra
    requirements can be configured via the
    ``kolla_ansible_venv_extra_requirements`` variable in
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/kolla.yml``. No extra packages are installed by
    default.
