    Improvements to Swift device management and ring generation.

    The device management and ring generation are now separate, with device management
    occurring during 'kayobe overcloud host configure', and ring generation during a
    new command, 'kayobe overcloud swift rings generate'.

    For the device management, we now use standard Ansible modules rather than commands
    for device preparation. File system labels can be configured for each device individually.

    For ring generation, all commands are run on a single host, by default a host in the Swift
    storage group. A python script runs in one of the kolla Swift containers, which consumes
    an autogenerated YAML config file that defines the layout of the rings.
