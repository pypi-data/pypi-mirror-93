Getting Started
---------------

We advise new users start by reading the :doc:`Architecture <architecture>`
documentation first in order to understand Kayobe's various components.

For users wishing to learn interactively we recommend starting at either
the :doc:`all-in-one overcloud <development/automated>` deployment or
the :ref:`'A Universe From Nothing' <a-universe-from-nothing>`
deployment guide.

Once familiar with Kayobe's constituent parts, move on to the
:doc:`Installation <installation>` section to prepare a baremetal environment
and then :doc:`Deployment <deployment>` to deploy to it.

* :doc:`Architecture <architecture>` - The function of Kayobe's host and
  networking components
