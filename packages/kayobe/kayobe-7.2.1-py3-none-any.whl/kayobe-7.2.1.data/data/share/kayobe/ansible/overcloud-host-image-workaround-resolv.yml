# The CentOS cloud images have a bogus name server entry in /etc/resolv.conf,
# 192.168.122.1. Cloud-init only appends name server entries to this file, and
# will not remove this bogus entry. Typically this leads to a delay of around
# 30 seconds when connecting via SSH, due to a timeout in NSS. The workaround
# employed here is to remove this bogus entry from the image using
# virt-customize, if it exists. See https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=14369.
