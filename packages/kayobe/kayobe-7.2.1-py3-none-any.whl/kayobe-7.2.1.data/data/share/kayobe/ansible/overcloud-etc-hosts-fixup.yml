# For some currently unknown reason, overcloud hosts end up with multiple
# entries in /etc/hosts that map their own hostname to their admin
# network IP address, in addition to one that maps their own hostname to their
# internal network IP address. This causes RabbitMQ upgrades to fail, as
# RabbitMQ expects the system's hostname to resolve to the IP address on
# which it is listening. As a workaround, we remove the stale entries from
# /etc/hosts.  See https://github.com/stackhpc/kayobe/issues/14.
