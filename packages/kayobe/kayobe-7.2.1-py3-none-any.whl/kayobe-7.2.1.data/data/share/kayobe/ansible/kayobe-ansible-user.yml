# NOTE(mgoddard): The bootstrap user may be used to create the kayobe user
# account and configure passwordless sudo. We can't assume that the bootstrap
# user account will exist after the initial bootstrapping, or that the
# current operator's key is authorised for the bootstrap user. We therefore
# attempt to access the kayobe user account via SSH, and only perform the
# bootstrap process if the account is inaccessible.
