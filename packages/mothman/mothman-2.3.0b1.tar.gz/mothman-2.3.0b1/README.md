Cydia/Sileo repository creation made ez.
Inspired by [repoman](https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/repoman).

**NOTE**: This project is **still** WIP and in alpha stage.

## Rationale

[repo.me](https://github.com/syns/repo.me) and [Reposi3](https://github.com/supermamon/Reposi3) are awesome Cydia repo templates, simplifying the creation of Cydia repos.
But it becomes tedious to manually create descriptions for every single package (which is actually done twice, for both Cydia and Sileo).
This project aims to automate the process of generating descriptions for all packages in a repo, as well as creating the `Packages` and `Release`  file (without `apt`, especially on Windows).

## Hey, what about [Silica](https://github.com/Shugabuga/Silica)?

The main advantage of mothman is that it is entirely pure-Python. Silica shells out to dpkg-deb (Debian-based systems, WSL). So you can use mothman on *both* WSL and native Windows.

## Features

- Pure-Python dependencies, portable (no more wrangling with `libapt.so` on non-Debian platforms)
- Automate repository management, including adding Debian packages and generating depictions for them (certain fields can be customised)
- Adds `Depiction` and `SileoDepiction` keys to `Packages` file for you

## Usage (WIP)

```bash
$ mothman init example  # or 'mothman init .' in an existing folder
$ cd example
# add your packages to debs folder
$ mothman build
```

## Depends

- `python` - At least version 3.6.
- `python-dpkg` - Debian package interface (already vendorised)
- `arpy` - Access `ar` archives

## Install

```bash
python(3) -m pip install mothman
```

## Build

All my python projects now use [flit](https://pypi.org/project/flit) to build and publish.
To build, do `flit build`.
