This experiment goal is to ensure that the loop blocks are working in usual
cases.

The flow is following:
- Two databases as inputs of a loop super block
- Outputs connect to standard blocks
- Outputs for standard blocks connected to another loop super block
- Outputs of that second super block connected to analyzers
