    Parameters
    ----------
    auth : Auth
        The object used to authenticate to the QMENTA platform.
    path : str
        The input directory or file that will be zipped (optional),
        anonymised (optional) and uploaded.
    file_info : FileInfo
        All the metadata for the file to be stored in the platform.
    anonymise : bool
        If set, a new zip file will be created with the same name which

        zip file. The new zip file will be uploaded instead of the original
        one. Default value: True.
    upload_index : int
        This value will be passed to the 'upload-status' and 'upload-progress'

    Attributes
    ----------
    input_filename : str
        The file that will be anonymised (optional), and uploaded.
    upload_filename : str
        The file that will be uploaded. If anonymisation is disabled, this
        will be the same as filename. With anonymisation enabled, a new file
        will be created that contains the anonymised data.
    upload_id : str
        The upload session ID. This will be automatically generated and
        depends on the current time and the upload filename.
    file_size : int
        The size in bytes of the file to be uploaded. Automatically determined
