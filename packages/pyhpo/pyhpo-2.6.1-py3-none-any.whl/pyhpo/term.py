        Set of direct and indirect parent HPOTerms

            This property is read-only

    comment: str
        Comments from HPO Team

        **Example:** ::

            Multicystic kidney dysplasia is the result of
            abnormal fetal renal development in which the affected kidney
            is replaced by multiple cysts and has little or no residual
            function. The vast majority of multicystic kidneys are unilateral.
            Multicystic kidney can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound.

    definition: str
        HPO Term Definition

        **Example:** ::

            "Multicystic dysplasia of the kidney is characterized by
            multiple cysts of varying size in the kidney and the absence of a
            normal pelvicaliceal system. The condition is associated with
            ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and the affected kidney is
            nonfunctional." [HPO:curators]

        .. warning::

           The string contains double-quote enclosed sections

    genes: set of :class:`pyhpo.annotations.Gene`
        All genes associated with the term or its children

        .. note::

            The set is recursively calcualted the first time it is requested
            by retrieving all children genes as well. The updated set is then
            cached.

            It is not possibe to remove genes from the set. Any updates will
            only allow addition of new genes.

        .. warning::

            Updating the associated gene set causes a recalculation of the
            cache and the caches of all parents, so this is a quite expensive
            operation and should be avoided.

    id: str
