## Alphafold2 - Pytorch (wip)

To eventually become an unofficial working Pytorch implementation of <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">Alphafold2</a>, the breathtaking attention network that solved CASP14. Will be gradually implemented as more details of the architecture is released.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install alphafold2-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from alphafold2_pytorch import Alphafold2
from alphafold2_pytorch.utils import MDScaling, center_distogram_torch

model = Alphafold2(
    dim = 256,
    depth = 2,
    heads = 8,
    dim_head = 64
).cuda()

seq = torch.randint(0, 21, (1, 128)).cuda()
msa = torch.randint(0, 21, (1, 5, 64)).cuda()
mask = torch.ones_like(seq).bool().cuda()
msa_mask = torch.ones_like(msa).bool().cuda()

distogram = model(
    seq,
    msa,
    mask = mask,
    msa_mask = msa_mask
) # (1, 128, 128, 37)

distances, weights = center_distogram_torch(distogram)

coords_3d, _ = MDScaling(distances, 
    weights = weights,
    iters = 200, 
    fix_mirror = 0
)
```

## Testing

```bash
$ python setup.py test
```

## Data

This library will use the awesome work by <a href="http://github.com/jonathanking">Jonathan King</a> at <a href="https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet">this repository</a>.

To install

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet.git
```

Or

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet.git
$ cd sidechainnet && pip install -e .
```

I have started construction of two approaches to equivariant self-attention. Both are still works in progress but should be done by end of January. Feel free to contribute.

Update - SE3 Transformers is in a good place, but Lie Transformer could use a code review, specifically how the location attention is handled
