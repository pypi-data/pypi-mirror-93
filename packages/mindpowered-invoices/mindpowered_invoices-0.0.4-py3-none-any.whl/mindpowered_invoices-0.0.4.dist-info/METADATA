# About
An invoice lists the quantities and costs of the products or services provided by a seller to a buyer. The top of the invoice usually includes the:
- contact information of the seller
- contact information of the buyer
- date of the invoice

In the middle of the invoice is a list of products or services. A line item refers to a line from this list. The line item describes the product or service, quantity, rate, price, and taxes.

At the bottom of the invoice is a summary which usually includes:
- subtotal (before tax)
- total (with tax) amount
- payment terms.

This package aims to provide the tools to create and edit invoices. This is useful for sending by the seller or receiving by the buyer.

# Requirements
