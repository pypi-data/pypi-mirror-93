"""
This module provides the base classes that define the interface for Structure
Function calculation on a given kinematic point (x, Q2) (that is why they are
called *Evaluated*).
They are:

:py:class:`EvaluatedStructureFunction` :
    this is a pure abstract class, that define the interface (defining the way
    in which coefficient functions are actually encoded) and implement some
    shared methods (like initializer and :py:meth:`get_output`, responsible also
    for :ref:`local caching<local-caching>`.

:py:class:`EvaluatedStructureFunctionLight` :
    this class is inheriting from the former, factorizing some common procedure
    needed for light calculation.

:py:class:`EvaluatedStructureFunctionHeavy` :
    this class is inheriting from the former, factorizing some common procedure
    needed for heavy quark calculation, like matching schemes

class EvaluatedStructureFunction:
    """
    The actual Structure Function implementation.

    This class is the abstract class that implements the structure for all
    the coefficient functions' providers, for a single kinematic point (x,
    Q2), but all the flavours (singlet, nonsinglet, gluon).

    Since the coefficient functions in general are distributions they are
    provided with an internal representation, that respects the interface
    defined by the class :py:class:`conv.DistributionVec`, and the same
    class is used to perform the convolution with the basis functions (see
    :py:class:`eko.InterpolatorDispatcher`), so the final result will
    consist of an array of dimension 2: one dimension corresponding to the
    interpolation grid, the other to the flavour.

    Its subclasses are organized by:

    - kind: `F2`, `FL`
    - flavour: `light`, `charm`, `bottom`, `top`

    and they all implement a :py:meth:`get_output` method that performs the
    calculation (convolution included), if needed.

    .. _local-caching:

    .. admonition:: Cache

        A part of the overall caching system is implemented at this level.

        The one implemented here is only a **local, isolated** caching,
        i.e.:

        - the first time the instance is asked for computing the result,
          through the :py:meth:`get_output` method, it registers the result;
        - any following call to the :py:meth:`get_output` method will make
          use of the cached result, and will never recompute it.

        If another instance with the same attributes is asked for the result
        it will recompute it from scratch, because any instance is isolated
        and doesn't keep any reference to the others.

        SF : StructureFunction

            from :py:mod:`eko`, e.g. :py:class:`InterpolatorDispatcher`) and
            implements the global caching
