tri.struct
==========

tri.struct supplies classes that can be used like dictionaries and as objects with attribute access at the same time. There are two versions:

- Struct: mutable struct
- FrozenStruct: immutable struct

Some niceties include:

- Predictable repr() so it's easy to write tests
- `merged` function call to merge different types of dicts into a new: `merged(Struct(a=1), FrozenStruct(b=1), c=1) == Struct(a=1, b=1, c=1)`)
- Accelerated implementation in c for improved speed. (With python-only fallback reference implementation)

Example
-------

.. code:: python

    >>> from tri_struct import Struct
    >>> foo = Struct()
    >>> foo.a = 1
    >>> foo['a']
    1
    >>> foo['a'] = 2
    >>> foo.a
    2
