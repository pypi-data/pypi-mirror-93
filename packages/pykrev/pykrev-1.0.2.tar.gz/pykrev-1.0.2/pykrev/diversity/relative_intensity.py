	Docstring for function pyKrev.relative_intensity 
	====================
	This function takes a matrix of peak intensities and calculates the relative intensities for each column. 
    
	Use
	----
	relative_intensity(Y)
    
	Returns a numpy array of shape(Y) in which each value is the relative intensity of that column.  
    
	Parameters
	----------
	Y: A list or numpy array containing peak intensities.  
    
    
	Info
	----------
	Relative peak intensity is calculated by summing all the intensities given in a column of Y,
	and dividing each item in the column (i) by the sum. So that sum(i...n) = 1.
