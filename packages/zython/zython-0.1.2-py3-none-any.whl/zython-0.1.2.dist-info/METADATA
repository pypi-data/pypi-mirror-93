Express constraint programming problem with python and solve it with minizinc.

Constraint programming (CP) is a paradigm for solving combinatorial problems.
Minizinc is used for model and optimization problems solving using CP.
You can express a model as a number of parameter, variables and constraints - 
minizinc will solve it (or said it if there isn't any solution).  

If you are wonder which digit should be assigned to letters, so the 
expression ``SEND+MORE=MONEY`` will be hold, or how many color you should have
to brush map of Australia and two states with the same border won't have any
common color, or try to understand which units you should hire in your 
favourite strategy game, so you will have the strongest army for that amount
of money you can use CP.

Zython lets you express such model with pure python, so there is no need to
learn a new language, and you can easily integrate CP into your python 
programs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You should have minizinc >=2.5 install and have it executable in ``$PATH``.
You can download it from [official site](https://www.minizinc.org/).
- Python 3.6+

### Installation

    pip install zython

### Usage

Our first example will be quadratic equation solving.

It can be expressed in minizinc as:

    var -100..100: x;
    int: a; int: b; int: c;
    constraint a*(x*x) + b*x = c;
    solve satisfy;

or using [minizinc-python](https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-python) package 
as

    import minizinc

    # Create a MiniZinc model
    model = minizinc.Model()
    model.add_string("""
    var -100..100: x;
    int: a; int: b; int: c;
    constraint a*(x*x) + b*x = c;
    solve satisfy;
    """)

    # Transform Model into a instance
    gecode = minizinc.Solver.lookup("gecode")
    inst = minizinc.Instance(gecode, model)
    inst["a"] = 1
    inst["b"] = 4
    inst["c"] = 0

    # Solve the instance
    result = inst.solve(all_solutions=True)
    for i in range(len(result)):
        print("x = {}".format(result[i, "x"]))

While zython makes it possible to describe this model using python only:

    class MyModel(zython.Model):
        def __init__(self, a: int, b: int, c: int):
            self.a = var(a)
            self.b = var(b)
            self.c = var(c)
            self.x = var(range(-100, 101))
            self.constraints = [self.a * self.x ** 2 + self.b * self.x + self.c == 0]

    model = MyModel(1, 4, 0)
    result = model.solve_satisfy(all_solutions=True)

## Collaboration

Zython uses the following libraries:

- Test is created with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) library
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/index.html) for test execution
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for coding style checking
- [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for documentation

Requirements necessary for zython run specified in *requirements.txt* file,
while testing, development requirements are specified in
*requirements_dev.txt*, and documentation requirements are in *requirements_doc.txt*.
For example, if you decided to fix bug, and you need no documentation fixes, you shouldn't
install *requirements_doc.txt*.
Project can be cloned from github and all dependencies can be installed via pip.

    git clone git@github.com:ArtyomKaltovich/zython.git
    python -m venv /path/to/new/venv if needed
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

Note: flake8 isn't specified as dependency in any file, this is made for
avoiding it installation for every python version tested in CI. You should
install it manually if you want to check your code before submitting PR.
You can do it with the following commands:

    pip install flake8
    nox -s lint

You can also run all checks locally:

    nox --reuse-existing-virtualenvs

It is recommended to open new issue and describe a bug or feature request
before submitting PR. While implementing new feature or fixing bug it is 
necessary to add tests to cover it.

Good Luck and thank you for improvements. :)
