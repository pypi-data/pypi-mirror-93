Release updates from the Chrome team
Stable Channel Update for Desktop
Thursday, June 15, 2017
The stable channel has been updated to 59.0.3071.104 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.
Security Fixes and Rewards
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.
This update includes 5 security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the Chrome Security Page for more information.
[$10,500][725032] High CVE-2017-5087: Sandbox Escape in IndexedDB. Reported by Ned Williamson on 2017-05-22
[$4,000][729991] High CVE-2017-5088: Out of bounds read in V8. Reported by Xiling Gong of Tencent Security Platform Department on 2017-06-06
[$2,000][714196] Medium CVE-2017-5089: Domain spoofing in Omnibox. Reported by Michał Bentkowski on 2017-04-21.
We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.
As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:
[732498] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives
Many of our security bugs are detected using AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, Control Flow Integrity, or libFuzzer.
A list of changes is available in the log. Interested in switching release channels? Find out how.  If you find a new issue, please let us know by filing a bug.  The community help forum is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
