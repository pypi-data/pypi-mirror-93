"""
The Mito package, which contains functions for creating a Mito sheet. 

To generate a new sheet, simply run:

import mitosheet
mitosheet.sheet()

If running mitosheet.sheet() just prints text that looks like `MitoWidget(...`, then you need to 
install the JupyterLab extension manager by running:

jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@2;

Run this command in the terminal where you installed Mito. It should take 5-10 minutes to complete.

Then, restart your JupyterLab instance, and refresh your browser. Mito should now render.

NOTE: if you have any issues with installation, please email book a demo time at https://hubs.ly/H0FwfYf0
