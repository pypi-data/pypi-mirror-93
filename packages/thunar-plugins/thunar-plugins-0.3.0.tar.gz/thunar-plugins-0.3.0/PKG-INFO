Description: # 🖱️ 🛠️ Thunar Plugins
        
        This Python package extends the [Thunar file manager](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) and provides a way for other Python packages to do the same without worrying about Thunar finding them.
        
        ## ✨ Features Added to Thunar
        
        - ✅ a settings menu to en-/disable plugins added by this or other Python packages
        
        - 🔗 creating links to a file or folder
        
        - ☑️  Calculating various checksums of files
        
        - 🗓️ *planned*: all features from [`thunar-custom-actions`](https://gitlab.com/nobodyinperson/thunar-custom-actions)
        
        
        ## 📦 Installation
        
        ![arch-logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch-Linux-success?style=for-the-badge&logo=arch-linux)
        ![manjaro-logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Manjaro-Linux-success?style=for-the-badge&logo=manjaro) 
        
        If you are on an Arch-based Linux, you can install [the `python-thunar-plugins-git` package from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-thunar-plugins-git/):
        
        ```bash
        # using yay, you may of course use your favourite AUR installer
        pacman -Syu yay
        yay -Syu python-thunar-plugins-git
        ```
        
        In this case you might only have to restart Thunar to see the new plugins:
        
        ```bash
        thunar -q
        ```
        
        ### Other Platforms: Installation from PyPI
        
        #### ☝️ Prerequisites
        
        For these Thunar plugins to work, you will need to have installed:
        
        - [Thunar](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar) (obviously)
        - [thunarx-python](https://gitlab.xfce.org/bindings/thunarx-python)
        
        
        Install this package from PyPI via
        
        ```bash
        pip install thunar-plugins
        ```
        
        > If that fails, try ```python3 -m pip install --user thunar-plugins```
        
        Or install it from the repository root via
        
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
        
        #### ⚡ Activating the Thunar Plugins
        
        As it is not possible (or at least deprecated) with `setuptools` to install files outside of the
        ”Python-realm”, one more step is required to activate the Thunar plugins after
        installation from PyPI:
        
        ```bash
        thunar-plugins activate
        ```
        
        > If that doesn't work, try ```python3 -m thunar_plugins activate```
        
        That should place an appropriate symlink for Thunar(x-python) to find the plugins.
        
        For Thunar to see the new plugins, you will need to restart it once:
        
        ```bash
        thunar -q  # or simply log out and back in again
        ```
        
        ## ➕ Adding More Plugins
        
        This `thunar_plugins` package can act as a stepping stone for other packages
        that add plugins to Thunar: The activator script loads all `thunar_plugin`
        entry points provided by any installed Python package. So if another package
        provides a Thunar plugin (e.g. a new context menu entry) with class
        `mypackage.mymodule.mysubmodule.MyThunarPlugin`, that package may adjust its
        `setup.cfg` like this and stop caring about how to tell Thunar where the plugin
        can be found:
        
        ```ini
        [options]
        install_requires = thunar_plugins
        
        [options.entry_points]
        thunar_plugin =
            my-thunar-plugin = mypackage.mymodule.mysubmodule:MyThunarPlugin
        ```
        
        > For proper display in the `thunar-plugins` settings dialog, every Python Thunar
        > plugin class registered like this should also have a short `name` and a
        > one-sentence `description` string attribute.
