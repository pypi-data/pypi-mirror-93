Usage
-----
The combine graph can be loaded with:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import selventa_knowledge
    >>> graph = selventa_knowledge.get_graph()

If you need granularity, you can load each graph in a dictionary where
all of the names of the files creating each graph are the keys and the
values are also BEL graphs with:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import selventa_knowledge
    >>> graphs = selventa_knowledge.get_graphs()

The functions from each of the previous examples are simply
exposing the bound functions from the BELRepository object,
which can be accessed with:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import selventa_knowledge
    >>> repository = selventa_knowledge.repository

If you want to use this knowledge with INDRA, there's a method:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import selventa_knowledge
    >>> statements = selventa_knowledge.repository.get_indra_statements()
