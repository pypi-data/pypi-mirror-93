## Project Description:
AinShamsFlow (asf) is a Deep Learning Framework built by our [Team](#Team-Members)
from Ain Shams University during December 2020 - January 2021.

The Design and Interface is inspired heavily from Keras and TensorFlow.

However, we only implement everything from scratch using only simple libraries
such as numpy and matplotlib.

## Install:
You can install the latest available version as follows:
```shell
$ pip install ainshamsflow
```

## Usage:
you start using this project my importing the package as follows:

```python
>>> import ainshamsflow as asf
```

then you can start creating a model:

```python
>>> model = asf.models.Sequential([
...     asf.layers.Dense(300, activation="relu"),
...     asf.layers.Dense(100, activation="relu"),
...     asf.layers.Dense( 10, activation="softmax")
... ], input_shape=(784,), name="my_model")
>>> model.print_summary()
```

then compile and train the model:

```python
>>> model.compile(
... 	optimizer=asf.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01),
... 	loss='sparsecategoricalcrossentropy',
...     metrics=['accuracy']
... )
>>> history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```

finally you can evaluate, predict and show training statistics:

```python
>>> history.show()
>>> model.evaluate(X_valid, y_valid)
>>> y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

A more elaborate example usage can be found in this
[demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sqEeUUkG3bTplhlLb73QCGUbaubX2aXi?usp=sharing).
