  title: An Intrinsic Information Content Metric for Semantic Similarity in WordNet.
  container-title: In Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-04),
  source: CiteSeer
  abstract: Abstract. Information Content (IC) is an important dimension of word knowledge when assessing the similarity of two terms or word senses. The conventional way of measuring the IC of word senses is to combine knowledge of their hierarchical structure from an ontology like WordNet with statistics on their actual usage in text as derived from a large corpus. In this paper we present a wholly intrinsic measure of IC that relies on hierarchical structure alone. We report that this measure is consequently easier to calculate, yet when used as the basis of a similarity mechanism it yields judgments that correlate more closely with human assessments than other, extrinsic measures of IC that additionally employ corpus analysis.

  abstract: Ontologies have long been employed in the life sciences to formally represent and reason over domain knowledge and they are employed in almost every major biological database. Recently, ontologies are increasingly being used to provide background knowledge in similarity-based analysis and machine learning models. The methods employed to combine ontologies and machine learning are still novel and actively being developed. We provide an overview over the methods that use ontologies to compute similarity and incorporate them in machine learning methods; in particular, we outline how semantic similarity measures and ontology embeddings can exploit the background knowledge in ontologies and how ontologies can provide constraints that improve machine learning models. The methods and experiments we describe are available as a set of executable notebooks, and we also provide a set of slides and additional resources at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies.

  abstract: This article presents a measure of semantic similarity in an IS-A taxonomy based on the notion of shared information content. Experimental evaluation against a benchmark set of human similarity judgments demonstrates that the measure performs better than the traditional edge-counting approach. The article presents algorithms that take advantage of taxonomic similarity in resolving syntactic and semantic ambiguity, along with experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.

  title: An Information-Theoretic Definition of Similarity
  container-title: ICML
  abstract: Similarity is an important and widely used concept. Previous definitions of similarity are tied to a particular application or a form of knowledge representation. We present an informationtheoretic definition of similarity that is applicable as long as there is a probabilistic model. We demonstrate how our definition can be used to measure the similarity in a number of different domains.

  abstract: Measuring information content (IC) from the intrinsic information of an ontology is an important however a formidable task. IC is useful for further measurement of the semantic similarity. Although the state-of-art metrics measure IC, they deal with external knowledge base or intrinsic hyponymy relations only. A current complex form of ontology conceptualizes a class (also often called as a concept) explicitly with the help of the hyponymy classes and the asserted relations and restrictions. Therefore, we propose a modified metric for measuring IC intrinsically taking both the concept-to-concept and the concept-to-property relations. We evaluate our system theoretically and with experimental data. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of our modified metric for extracting intrinsic information content to measure semantic similarity among concepts in an ontology.
