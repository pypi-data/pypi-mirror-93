# Kompute Python Example

This folder contains the accompanying code for the article "High Performance Python for GPU Accelerated Machine Learning in Cross-Vendor GPUs".

The easiest way to try this example is by using the [Google Binder Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15uQ7qMZuOyk8JcXF-3SB2R5yNFW21I4P), which will allow you to use a GPU for free and runs without much setup.

Alternatively if you want to test the example yourself locally, you can get setup and started through the following links:

1. Install the [Kompute Python Package](https://kompute.cc/overview/python-package.html#package-installation)
2. Run the [Array Multiplication Code](https://github.com/EthicalML/vulkan-kompute/blob/python_extensions/python/test/test_array_multiplication.py)
3. Run the [Logistic Regression Code](https://github.com/EthicalML/vulkan-kompute/blob/python_extensions/python/test/test_logistic_regression.py)
