Description: # mysql_tracer
        A MySQL client to run queries, write execution reports and export results.
        
        It is made with the purpose to support SELECT statements only.
        Other statements will work but the features offered by this module will provide little help or make no sense.
        
        It uses Python 3.
        
        ## Installing
        
        Package is available on PyPi:
        
            pip install mysql_tracer
        
        ## Usage
        
        This package defines a command line tool named `mst`.
        To get help about how to use it: `mst -h`
        
        It exposes the class `Query`. The constructor needs a path to a file containing a single sql statement and instances 
        expose the method `export` which creates a timestamped copy of the original file with additional metadata and
        the results exported in the CSV format.
        
        ## Development
        
        You can install development dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        
        You can run tests with `pytest`.
        
            pytest
        
        You can run the module from sources by running the whole package:
        
            python mysql_tracer -h
        
        You can build a package with setuptools.
        
            python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        All dependencies have their version frozen.
        To install new versions of the dependencies, uninstall them, install the mysql-tracer package and then freeze them again
        
            pip freeze | xargs pip uninstall -y
            python setup.py sdist
            pip install -e .[dev]
            pip freeze | grep -v mysql-tracer > requirements.txt
