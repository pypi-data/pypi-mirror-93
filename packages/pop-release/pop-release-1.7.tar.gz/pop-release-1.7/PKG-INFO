        ===========
        
        Pop Release is a simple tool to automate the process of creating a release.
        When making POP software releases should be happening very quickly, every
        few commits should justify a release.
        
        Since releases happen so frequently, and since they should be executed in
        an identical way from project to project, pop-release becomes a simple command
        to update the release locally and on pypi.
