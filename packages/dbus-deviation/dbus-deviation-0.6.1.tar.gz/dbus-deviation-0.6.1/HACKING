Formatting
==========

All code should follow PEP8.

Commit messages
===============

dbus-deviation does not use a ChangeLog; it is auto-generated from the git log
when packaging a release. Commit messages should use a short tag in the commit
summary to allow easy identification of which part of the code base they
touch.

Versioning
==========

dbus-deviation uses an even–odd/stable–unstable versioning policy, where odd
minor version numbers are unstable releases, released periodically (with
increasing micro version numbers) and leading to a stable release with the
next even minor version number. API breaks are allowed in micro releases with
an odd minor version number, but not in micro releases with an even minor
version number.

It is encouraged to make a new micro release of an odd minor series after each
large API or feature addition or break.
