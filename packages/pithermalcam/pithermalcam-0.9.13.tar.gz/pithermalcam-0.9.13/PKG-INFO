Description: # README #
        
        Documentation of the pithermalcam project and accompanying [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/pithermalcam/), which connects an MLX90640 thermal camera up to a Raspberry Pi. (Built on a Pi 4)
        
        Setup based primarily off the article at https://makersportal.com/blog/2020/6/8/high-resolution-thermal-camera-with-raspberry-pi-and-mlx90640#thermal-cam, with additions from https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply/ and flask pieces based on https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/09/02/opencv-stream-video-to-web-browser-html-page/. Many thanks to Joshua Hrisko, Валерий Курышев, and Adrian Rosebrock for their work in these articles.
        
        Full details for this project are available at https://tomshaffner.github.io/PiThermalCam/, including comprehensive hardware/software setup, install, and usage instructions. A cursory overview for development purposes only is included here.
        
        ### Manual Install/Setup ###
        
        This section discusses software setup only, and assumes you have hardware set up, the MLX90640 correctly wired up, and the baudrate increased to 400k.
        
        This install is for manual operation of the library. For the Pip install from PyPi simply execute a pip install for pithermalcam.
        
        1. Install, using apt-get, the following items:
        libatlas-base-dev
        python-smbus
        i2c-tools
        
        2. Install remaining requirements using either:
        a. 
            pip3 install the requirements.txt
        or
        b. 
            pip3 install the requirements_without_opencv.txt
        
            Download, build, and install OpenCV locally (painstaking process, but results in more optimized code).
        
            Install cmapy using --no-deps pip3 flag to avoid installing OpenCV via pip3.
        
        
        ### Usage ###
        
        #### Pip Library Install ####
        
        If you install the library via Pip you can follow the usage shown in the examples folder to see usage instructions.
        
        #### Clone library locally ####
        If you wish to clone the library, execute this clone command:
        
        `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/tomshaffner/PiThermalCam.git`
        
        This clones the code without cloning the pictures for the accompanying article (which take up more space).
        
        To operate from here:
        
        1. Copy the icons to your desktop and make executable.
        
        or
        
        2. Run the files directly in python3:
        
        Run pithermalcam/web_server.py to set up a flask server and strean live video.
        
        Run pithermalcam/pi_therm_cam.py to display the video feed onscreen.
        
        Check sequential_versions folder for sequential running approaches that are easier to track/follow (i.e. not object-oriented). These are less robust, but can be easier to understand/track/edit, particularly for those coming from a scientific background. Again, refer to the link at top for a detailed discussion.
