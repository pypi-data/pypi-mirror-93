        This is an auxiliary service for discovering hardware properties for a
        node managed by `Ironic`_. Hardware introspection or hardware
        properties discovery is a process of getting hardware parameters required for
        scheduling from a bare metal node, given its power management credentials
        (e.g. IPMI address, user name and password).
