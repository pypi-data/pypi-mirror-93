This directory contains reST exports of jupyter notebooks, so that the static 
notebooks can be included in the documentation.

reST files in this directory are placed inline using the 'include' directive.
To create these files, download the notebook as reST (requires pandoc). 
Image links (for plots) must be hand-edited. Plot images should be renamed and 
put in the '_static/notebook_plots/' directory.

If sphinx generates a lot of errors that look like the following, this may be 
caused by C function calls being parsed as reST. Pointer notation looks like 
emphasis/strong start-strings. To fix it, change the '.. parsed-literal::' to 
the non-parsed version '::'.
	WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
	WARNING: Inline strong start-string without end-string.
