# You can manipulate a data structure into another with the functions of the package. It supports biadjacency matrices (numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices), edgelists, adjacency lists (dictionaries) or just the degree sequences.

# Let's create an edgelist with names.

# These data type converters return additional objects, keeping track of the node labeling and the node degrees.
# The desired data structure is always at index 0. Check the documentation for more info.

# Now we can use the edgelist to create the bipartite graph. In two ways:

myGraph = BipartiteGraph(edgelist=edgelist_names)

# And now let's simply compute the bicm! This should run instantly. The solver checks that the solution is correct automatically.

x = myGraph.x
y = myGraph.y
rows_dict = myGraph.rows_dict
cols_dict = myGraph.cols_dict


# Alternatively, you can have the bicm matrix of probabilities, whose entries i, j are the bicm probabilities of having a link between nodes i and j (who will correspond to rows_dict[i] and cols_dict[j]), or compute it on your own

# And, if you like, you can check the solution by yourself:
# The data type conversions are generally consistent with the order, so this works

# You can then sample from the BiCM ensemble in two ways, via matrix sampling or edgelist sampling.

# Now let's compute the projection: it can take some seconds.

# These projections only contain links between nodes that behave similarly with respect to the expected behavior calculated from the BiCM. They could also be empty:

# Increasing alpha too much will make the projection too dense. 
# It is not suggested: if it is empty with a high alpha, try different projections.
# Check the documentation and the papers for more info.
myGraph.compute_projection(rows=False, alpha=0.2)

# Different projection methods are implemented. 
# They differ in the way of approximating the poisson-binomial distribution of the similarities between nodes.
# By default, the poisson approximation is used, since the poisson binomial is very expensive to compute. Check the docs for more!
# Here, an example of the poibin implementation. This can take even some minutes, and it's faster when using a biadjacency matrix instead of other data types. Note that the poisson approximation is fairly good.

# If you want to retrieve the p-values of the projection on one layer, use one of the following functions:

pval_list = projection_calculator(biad_mat, avg_mat, return_pvals=True)


# Finally, if you want to manage the calculation of the pvalues for the projection on your own, you can use the class PvaluesHandler (see more in the docs)

# For the projection on the rows layer:
v_list = vmotifs_from_adjacency_list(adj_list)
