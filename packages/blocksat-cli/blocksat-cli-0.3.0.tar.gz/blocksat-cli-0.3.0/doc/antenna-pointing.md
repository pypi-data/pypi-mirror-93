# Antenna Pointing

Aligning a satellite antenna is a precise procedure. Remember that the
satellites are over 35,000 km (22,000 mi) away. A tenth of a degree of error
will miss the satellite by more than 3500 km. Hence, this is likely the most
time-consuming step of the process. This page provides a step-by-step guide for
the antenna alignment.

## Mount the Antenna

First of all, you should obtain the pointing angles required for your specific
location using our [**Dish Alignment
Tool**](https://blockstream.com/satellite/#satellite-resources).

After entering your address or latitude/longitude, the tool will give you the
following parameters:

- **Azimuth**: the side to side angle of your antenna. 0 degrees refers to
  North, 90 degrees to East, 180 degrees to South, and 270 degrees to West.

- **Elevation**: the up and down adjustment of your antenna. The antenna aiming
  tool provides the number of degrees above the horizon to which your antenna
  must point. 0 degrees represents pointing at the horizon, and 90 degrees is
  pointing straight up.

- **Polarity**: determines the rotation of the LNB rather than the dish. It is
  the angle of the LNB within the LNB mounting bracket (or holder). Often this
  is referred to also as the LNB *rotational angle* or *LNB skew*.

The three angles are illustrated below:

Azimuth                                        |  Elevation                                           | Polarity                                                  |
:---------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
![Azimuth](img/azimuth.png?raw=true "Azimuth") | ![Elevation](img/elevation.png?raw=true "Elevation") | ![Polarity](img/lnb_polarization.png?raw=true "Polarity") |

Next, visually inspect the direction to which your antenna must point. Use a
compass or smartphone app (e.g., Satellite Pointer for
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tda.satpointer) and
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/satellite-pointer/id994565490)) to identify
it. Ensure that there are no obstacles (like trees or buildings) between your
antenna and the target area in the sky. You must have a clear line of sight to
that area of the sky.

**IMPORTANT:** If using a compass app on a smartphone, make sure to configure
the app to display **true north** instead of the **magnetic north**. The azimuth
angle provided by our dish alignment tool refers to true north. Also, if using
an ordinary compass or a compass-based satellite finder, make sure to convert
the true azimuth obtained from the dish alignment tool into magnetic
azimuth. You can get both the true and magnetic azimuth angles using a tool such
as the [Dish Pointer](https://www.dishpointer.com).

Next, install the satellite antenna according to the directions accompanying it,
or have it done professionally. If you install it yourself, proceed with the
following steps:

1. Certify that the pole on which the dish is mounted is completely level.
2. Set the elevation of the antenna to the parameter provided by the antenna
   aiming tool (above). Many antennas will have an elevation scale on the back
   of the dish that you can use to set the approximate elevation.
3. Set the LNB polarization to the parameter provided by the antenna aiming
   tool. This involves rotating the LNB. There is typically a polarization
   rotation scale on the LNB or the LNB mounting bracket.
4. Set the azimuth angle to the value obtained from the aiming tool.

Initially, you can leave the screws that control the azimuth angle slightly
loose so that you can adjust the azimuth for pointing. You can do the same for
elevation and polarization. Nevertheless, the azimuth is typically easier to
sweep as an initial pointing attempt.

## Find the Satellite and Lock the Signal

Assuming that the receiver is configured correctly and connected, your next step
is to find the satellite. You will adjust the antenna pointing until the
receiver can lock to Blockstream Satellite's signal. Please note that this is
likely the most time-consuming part of the setup process, especially when doing
it for the first time. As mentioned earlier, a single degree shifted on the dish
represents a change of thousands of kilometers over the geosynchronous orbit.

The process will be easier with a laptop than can be watched while moving the
antenna. If you cannot watch the computer, youâ€™ll need two people: one to move
the antenna and one to monitor the computer.

To start, make sure that your receiver is running. Depending on your type of
receiver, this step involves one of the following commands:

- For the TBS 5927 USB ([Basic
Kit](https://store.blockstream.com/product/blockstream-satellite-basic-kit/))
Receiver: `blocksat-cli usb launch`.

- For the Novra S400 Standalone ([Pro
Kit](https://store.blockstream.com/product/blockstream-satellite-pro-kit/))
Receiver: `blocksat-cli standalone monitor` (see the [S400's
instructions](s400.md#monitoring)).

- For the SDR receiver: `blocksat-cli sdr`.

Next, you should monitor the receiver logs printed to the console. Initially,
while the antenna is not pointed correctly, the receiver will be unlocked. In
this case, the application will print logs like the following:

```
2020-10-23 14:26:14  Lock = False;
```

In this case, you should try to make adjustments to the antenna pointing. For
example, keep the elevation angle fixed and slowly move the antenna side to side
(vary the azimuth angle). Alternatively, keep the azimuth fixed and gradually
change the elevation. Every time you adjust an angle, wait a few seconds and
check if the receiver has found the signal in this position. If not, try another
adjustment and so on.

Once the receiver finds the signal, it will lock and print a line like the
following:

```
2020-10-23 14:32:25  Lock = True; Level = -47.98dBm; SNR = 11.30dB; BER = 0.00e+00;
```

From this point on, the application should remain locked.

You should pay special attention to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) parameter
printed on the console. The higher the SNR, the better. Given that the receiver
is already locked, you can infer that the antenna pointing is close to the
optimal position. Hence, at this point, you should experiment with gentle
adjustments to the pointing angles until you can maximize the SNR. The next
section discusses the target SNR levels.

Furthermore, you can check that the signal level is within the acceptable
limits. The LNB amplifies the signal received over satellite and feeds a
reasonably high signal level into the receiver. However, the signal experiences
attenuation over the coaxial cable, connectors, and adapters. The expected
minimum and maximum signal levels are summarized below:

| Receiver   | Minimum Signal Level | Maximum Signal Level |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| TBS 5927   | -69 dBm              | -23 dBm              |
| Novra S400 | -65 dBm              | -25 dBm              |

In the end, note that the antenna pointing procedure is entirely based on the
locking indicator printed to the console. Once you find the signal and the
receiver locks, the only remaining step is to [optimize the
SNR](#optimize-the-snr).

This approach works for all types of receivers. However, there are helpful
receiver-specific instructions for the pointing process, listed below:

- **Novra S400 Standalone receiver**: you can find various receiver status
metrics within the receiver's web interface. See [the
instructions](#novra-s400s-user-interface).
- **SDR receiver**: with an SDR receiver, you can visualize the signal spectrum
  and point the antenna more easily. See [the SDR
  instructions](#pointing-with-an-sdr-based-receiver).

Alternatively, you can try to point the antenna using a satellite finder. This
approach is generally more useful for the TBS5927 and S400 receivers. In
contrast, for SDR-based receivers, the [SDR signal visualization
tools](#pointing-with-an-sdr-based-receiver) are generally sufficient for
pointing. Refer to the instructions in the [satellite finder
section](#pointing-with-a-satellite-finder).

## Optimize the SNR

Blockstream Satellite's signal is composed of two multiplexed channels, one of
which requires higher signal quality to be decoded. The two channels are
summarized next:

| Channel             | Throughput | Minimum SNR | Recommended SNR | Purpose                                                                              |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 (Low-throughput)  | ~96 kbps   | 1 dB        | 4 dB            | Repeats the past 24h of blocks and keeps receiver nodes in sync                      |
| 2 (High-throughput) | ~1.55 Mbps | 6.62 dB     | 9 dB            | Broadcasts the entire blockchain and keeps receiver nodes in sync with lower latency |


After the initial antenna pointing, your receiver may have locked to Channel 1
but not Channel 2. Hence, we recommend experimenting with the pointing until you
achieve your maximum SNR. If your receiver is already locked, try gentle
adjustments around the current position and observe the SNR on the console. Stop
once you find the pointing that achieves the best SNR.

The optimization of the pointing is beneficial not only to receive both channels
but also for margin. For example, if your receiver operates at 8 dB, it has a 7
dB margin relative to the minimum SNR to receive Channel 1. This margin means
that your receiver can tolerate up to 7 dB signal attenuation in case of bad
weather.

If you have peaked the SNR and it still does not meet the requirements for
Channel 2, your antenna size may not be sufficient. As explained in the
[hardware guide](hardware.md#satellite-dish), we recommend using a 90 cm or
larger dish to receive the high-throughput channel (Channel 2).

Nevertheless, regardless of the SNR, the USB (TBS 5927) and standalone (Novra
S400) receivers will continuously try to receive both channels. For example, if
you begin with insufficient SNR for Channel 2 due to weather conditions, and,
later on, the SNR improves, the receiver will start to get the Channel 2 packets
automatically. In contrast, this is **not currently possible** with the SDR
receiver. In the SDR setup, you will need to specify the channel you want to
tune to, as explained in the [SDR Guide](sdr.md#running).

## Next Steps

Well done. Your receiver is properly set-up! Now, you are ready to run the
Bitcoin Satellite application receiving data via the Blockstream Satellite
Network. Please refer to the [Bitcoin Satellite guide](bitcoin.md) for further
instructions.

## Further Information

### Novra S400's User Interface

The Novra S400 receiver features a [web-based user interface
(UI)](s400.md#s400s-web-user-interface-ui), which provides several receiver
metrics.

At the top, the web UI has an *LNB* indicator, which indicates whether the S400
is supplying power to the LNB. Furthermore it shows whether the S400 is
locked. Assuming you have connected the LNB to input RF1, then the **RF1 Lock**
indicator will be green when the unit is locked.

![S400 Searching](img/s400_searching.png?raw=true "S400 Searching")

If the S400 is **not** locked yet, as depicted above (RF1 Lock indicator off),
you should [adjust the antenna
pointing](#find-the-satellite-and-lock-the-signal).

Once the S400 finally locks, the *RF1 Lock* indicator looks as follows:

![S400 Locked](img/s400_locked.png?raw=true "S400 Locked")

You can also find signal quality and status metrics on page `Interfaces > RF1`,
under *RF1 Detailed Status*. For example:

![S400 RF Status](img/s400_rf_status.png?raw=true "S400 RF Status")

Note that the carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N) parameter relates to the SNR
 parameter that should be [optimized during the antenna
 pointing](#optimize-the-snr).

### Pointing with an SDR-based Receiver

The SDR-based receiver offers additional visualization tools that are very
helpful for antenna pointing. With this receiver, the pointing procedure
consists of two steps:

1. Visualization using `gqrx`;
2. Locking using the actual receiver application.

In the first step, you should launch `gqrx` (check the gqrx [configuration
instructions](sdr.md#configuration)). Then, click the start icon ("Start DSP
Processing") and see if you can recognize the Blockstream Satellite
signal. Ideally, you would see a flat level spanning a frequency band (in the
horizontal axis) of approximately 1 MHz. Here is an example:

![Signal visible on Gqrx](img/gqrx-offset.png?raw=true "Signal visible on Gqrx")

With the [recommended gqrx configuration](sdr.md#configuration), gqrx should be
configured to the center frequency of the signal band (in this example, of
12066.9 MHz, where the red line is). However, the observed signal commonly is
offset from the nominal center frequency, given that LNBs introduce frequency
offset. In the above example, note the signal is around 12066.6 MHz, which means
a frequency offset of -300 kHz (to the left relative to the nominal center). If
gqrx's center frequency is re-configured to 12066.6 MHz, then we can see the 1
MHz band well centered, like so:

![Signal centered on Gqrx](img/gqrx-centered.png?raw=true "Signal centered on Gqrx")

If you can't see the signal on gqrx, you should try to make adjustments to the
antenna pointing, as [described
earlier](#find-the-satellite-and-lock-the-signal).

> NOTE:
>
> If you see two similar signal bands near each other, try to identify which one
> is more likely to be the Blockstream Satellite signal. The correct signal

>
> Furthermore, please note that, in some cases, there can be similar signal
> bands among different (but nearby) satellites. In this case, you need to
> adjust the pointing until you get a lock.

Once you finally find the signal in gqrx, you can proceed to run the actual SDR
receiver application. As explained in the [SDR guide](sdr.md#running), you can
start it with:

```
blocksat-cli sdr
```

For pointing, however, it is useful to run it in GUI mode, as follows:

```
blocksat-cli sdr --gui
```

At this point, before proceeding, it is helpful to inspect whether the gain is
well configured. Check the preprocessed (iq) plot. If it looks like the one
below, with strongly scattered points around the two dimensions, the gain is
likely too high. In this case, you can run with a lower gain specified using
option `-g`, like so:

```
blocksat-cli sdr -g [gain]
```

![Pre-processed IQ](img/leandvb-pre-processed-iq.png?raw=true "Pre-processed IQ")

The default gain is 40, and you can then experiment with lower values.

The IQ points should form a more compact cloud of points, such as the one below:

![Pre-processed IQ w/ lower Rx gain](img/leandvb-pre-processed-iq2.png?raw=true "Pre-processed IQ w/ lower Rx gain")

More information is available in [Section 9.2 of the leandvb application's
user guide](http://www.pabr.org/radio/leandvb/leandvb.en.html).

Next, observe the spectrum plots. The spectrum plot shows the limits of the
central band in red lines. In the example that follows, the signal presents the
frequency offset of roughly -300 kHz that we already knew about from our
observation on gqrx:

![Leandvb spectrum w/ offset signal](img/leandvb-spectrum-offset.png?raw=true "Leandvb spectrum w/ offset signal")

> NOTE: each LNB introduces a unique frequency offset, which also varies over
> time. The above value of -300 kHz was specific to the example setup. Your
> frequency offset will be different.

To correct the known offset, you can run with option `--derotate`, as follows:

```
blocksat-cli sdr -g [gain] --derotate [freq_offset]
```

where `freq_offset` represents the offset in kHz that you want to correct.

With that, the preprocessed spectrum plot should be centered, as follows:

![Leandvb spectrum w/ centered signal](img/leandvb-spectrum-centered.png?raw=true "Leandvb spectrum w/ centered signal")

At this point, if the antenna pointing is already reasonably good, you might see
the "PLS cstln" plot showing four visible clouds:

![PLS symbols](img/leandvb-pls-syms.png?raw=true "PLS symbols")

This plot indicates that the receiver application is locked to Blockstream
Satellite's signal. Note that the more compact the four clouds of points are in
this plot (around the white `+` marker), the better the signal quality.

If you cannot see the the "PLS cstln" plot, it means you are not locked to the
signal yet. You can troubleshoot further in debug mode by running like so (with
argument `-d`):

```
blocksat-cli sdr -g [gain] --derotate [freq_offset] --gui -d
```

If you see the following logs continuously printed in the console, it means you
are not locked to the signal yet:

```
DETECT
PROBE
```

When a lock is acquired, you will see the following log printed to the console:

```
LOCKED
```

After that, you should start seeing several underscores `_` printed
consecutively as indicators of successful data reception. The reception
indicator can be one of the three indicators below:

- `_`: indicates a DVB-S2 frame received without errors.
- `.`: indicates an error-corrected DVB-S2 frame.
- `!`: indicates a DVB-S2 frame with remaining errors.

If you cannot lock to the signal, you should try further adjustments to the
antenna. Assuming you have identified the signal on gqrx before, you can infer
that the pointing is already very close. Therefore, only subtle adjustments are
required at this point.

Finally, once the receiver locks to the signal, you can still try to improve the
SNR. Observe the SNR values printed to the console and see if you can get better
values after subtle adjustments to the pointing.

In the end, once you are satisfied with the SNR (see the [target
levels](#optimize-the-snr)), you can monitor several aspects of your SDR
receiver. For example:

- To monitor the bitrate, run with option `--monitor-bitrate`.
- To monitor MPEG TS packet decoding errors, run with option `--monitor-ts`.
- For low-level debugging information, run with option `-dd`.

### Pointing with a Satellite Finder

In some cases, it is useful to try pointing with a satellite finder instead of
using the satellite receiver directly.

A satellite finder usually has two connections: one to the LNB (typically
labeled as *satellite*) and one to the receiver. The receiver connection is used
to provide power to the finder. However, some finders come with an alternative
power supply, in which case the connection to the receiver is unnecessary.

Some finders only measure the signal level, whereas other models can demodulate
signals and lock to them. Both approaches are considered in the sequel.

A basic finder model (such as the `SF-95DR` included on [satellite
kits](https://store.blockstream.com/product-category/satellite_kits/)) can only
measure signal level. In this case, connect the finder inline between the
receiver (TBS5927 or S400) and the LNB. Run the receiver normally so that the
receiver can power up the finder. Then, try to point the antenna until you get
adequate signal levels on the finder. Once you achieve good signal strength on
the finder, check if the receiver is locked too ([see the previous
instructions](#find-the-satellite-and-lock-the-signal)).

Next, if you are using a satellite finder that supports DVB-S2 demodulation, you
can configure it to lock to a free-to-air (FTA) TV signal. The rationale is that
the Blockstream Satellite signal runs in a DVB-S2 mode (called VCM - *variable
coding and modulation*) that is not supported by most satellite finders that can
demodulate DVB-S2. In contrast, FTA TV signals often run on a supported
(simpler) mode called CCM (*constant coding and modulation*). Thus, you can use
an FTA TV signal in the same satellite as a reference to make sure that your
antenna is pointed to the correct satellite.

For such models of satellite finders (with DVB-S2 demodulation), we recommend
running the finder standalone rather than inline with the receiver, given that
typically both of them will try to power the LNB. In this case, you can connect
the finder's `satellite` port directly to the LNB, provided that the finder is
adequately powered.

Next, define the parameters of the reference FTA TV signal. There are lists of
signals available on the web. For example, refer to the following lists for the
satellites used by the Blockstream Satellite network:
- [Galaxy 18](https://www.lyngsat.com/Galaxy-18.html)
- [Eutelsat 113](https://www.lyngsat.com/Eutelsat-113-West-A.html)
- [Telstar 18N](https://www.lyngsat.com/Telstar-11N.html)
- [Telstar 18V](https://www.lyngsat.com/Telstar-18-Vantage.html)

After choosing a TV signal, you need to configure the finder with the signal
parameters. Typically, you will need to set the following:

- LO Frequency: the frequency of your LNB. If you are unsure, run the CLI
  command below:

  ```
  blocksat-cli instructions
  ```

  The LO frequency will be displayed on the first page.

- Downlink Frequency: the downlink frequency of the FTA TV signal of choice.
- Symbol rate: the symbol rate of the FTA TV signal of choice. This is often
  abbreviated as `SR`. So, for example, on [this
  list](https://www.lyngsat.com/Eutelsat-113-West-A.html), you see a column
  labeled `SR-FEC`, which stands for the *symbol rate* and *FEC*.
- Polarity: whether the signal is horizontal or vertically polarized. This is
  usually informed next to the downlink frequency with the letter `V` (for
  vertical) or `H` (for horizontal).
- 22 kHz: this refers to a 22 kHz signal that changes the LO frequency of a
  Universal LNB. See [the notes regarding Universal
  LNBs](hardware.md#universal-lnb). You only need to enable this option if you
  are using a Universal LNB and if the FTA TV signal you selected is in [Ku high
  band](frequency.md). Otherwise, leave it disabled.

For example, the following table provides information regarding an FTA TV
signal:

| Frequency | SR-FEC   |
|-----------|----------|
|  	11974 V | 3330-2/3 |

In this case, the signal has the following properties:
- The downlink frequency is 11974 MHz.
- The symbol rate is 3330 ksymbols/second (or kbaud).
- The downlink signal is vertically polarized (see the `V` next to the downlink
  frequency).

After you configure the satellite finder, you will typically be presented with
signal strength and (or) quality indicators. Try to point your antenna until you
can maximize these levels.

Once you lock to the FTA TV signal on the satellite finder, you can infer that
the antenna is directed to the correct satellite. At this point, you can
disconnect the satellite finder and connect the LNB/antenna back to your
receiver. Your next step is to verify that your receiver can lock to the
Blockstream Satellite signal. Thus, follow the [instructions presented
earlier](#find-the-satellite-and-lock-the-signal).
