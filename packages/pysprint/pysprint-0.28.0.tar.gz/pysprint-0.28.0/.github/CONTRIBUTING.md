## Reporting issues

When reporting issues please include as much detail as possible about your
operating system, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PyQt5 version and python version. Whenever possible,
please also include a brief, self-contained code/screenshot example that demonstrates the problem.
Pysprint has a built-in `print_info` function which holds all the relevant information. Use it as follows:

```python
import pysprint as ps
ps.print_info()
```

This outputs something like this:

```python
