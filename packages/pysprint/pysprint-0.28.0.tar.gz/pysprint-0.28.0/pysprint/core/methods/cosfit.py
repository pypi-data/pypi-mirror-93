        Cosine fit optimizer. It's based on adding new terms to fit
        function successively until we reach the maximum order.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reference_point : float
            The reference point on the x axis.
        order : int, optional
            Polynomial (and maximum dispersion) order to fit. Must be in [1, 6].
            Default is 3.
        initial_region_ratio : float, optional
            The initial region in portion of the length of the dataset
            (0.1 will mean 10%, and so on..). Note that the bigger
            resolution the interferogram is, the lower it should be set.
            Default is 0.1. It should not be set too low, because too small
            initial region can result in failure.
        extend_by : float, optional
            The coefficient determining how quickly the region of fit is
            growing. The bigger resolution the interferogram is (or in general
            the higher the dispersion is), the lower it should be set.
            Default is 0.1.
        coef_threshold: float, optional
            The desired R^2 threshold which determines when to expand the region
            of fitting. It's often enough to leave it as is, however if you decide to
            change it, it is highly advised not to set a higher value than 0.7.
            Default is 0.3.
        max_tries : int, optional
            The maximum number of tries to fit a curve before failing.
            Default is 5000.
        show_endpoint : bool, optional
            If True show the fitting results when finished.
            Default is True.

        Note
        ----
        If the fit fails some parameters must be tweaked in order to
        achieve results. There is a list below with issues,
        its suspected reasons and solutions.

        **SciPy raises OptimizeWarning and the affected area is small
        or not showing any fit**

        Reasons:
        Completely wrong initial GD guess (or lack of guessing).
        Too broad inital region, so that the optimizer cannot find a
        suitable fit.

        This usually happens when the used data is large, or the spectral
        resolution is high.

        Solution:
        Provide better inital guess for GD.
        Lower the inital_region_ratio.

        **SciPy raises OptimizeWarning and the affected area is bigger**

        Reasons: When the optimizer steps up with order it also extends the
        region of fit.

        This error usually present when the region of fit is too quickly
        growing.

        Solution:
        Lower extend_by argument.

        **The optimizer is finished, but wrong fit is produced.**

        Reasons:
        We measure the goodness of fit with r^2 value. To allow this
        optimizer to smoothly find appropriate fits even for noisy datasets
        it's a good practice to keep the r^2 a lower value, such as
        the default 0.3. The way it works is we step up in order of fit
        (until max order) and extend region every time when a fit reaches
        the specified r^2 threshold value. This can be controlled via the
        coef_threshold argument.

        Solution:
        Adjust the coef_threshold value. Note that it's highly
        recommended not to set a higher value than 0.6.
