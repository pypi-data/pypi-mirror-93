Description: MicroGP (ÂµGP, `ugp`) is yet another [evolutionary optimizer](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/evolution.html) able to outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics. Over the years it has been exploited as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), as a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), and as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas. [Some hundreds papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28+MicroGP+OR+%C2%B5GP+OR+ugp3+OR+ugp2+%29+AND+%28+Squillero+OR+Tonda+OR+Sanchez+OR+Schillaci+%29) discussing it can be found in the scientific literature. 
        
        [MicroGP4](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/) has been redesigned from scratch in Python to exploit the strengths of the language and its vibrant ecosystem. It is [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and it is distributed under the permissive [Apache License 2.0](https://www.tldrlegal.com/l/apache2).
