      title: Base TensorStore to downsample.
      description: |
        Downsampling is always performed with respect to an origin of 0 in all
        dimensions in the :json-member:`base` TensorStore.  To use a different
        origin, translate the domain by specifying an
        :json-schema:`https://github.com/google/tensorstore/json-schema/index-transform`
        via the :json-member:`transform` property of :json-member:`base`.
        
        Translating the domain of the downsampled view by a given ``offset`` is
        equivalent to translating the domain of :json-member:`base` by ``offset
        * downsample_factors``.  However, there is no translation of the
        downsampled view that is exactly equivalent to translating the domain of
        :json-member:`base` by an offset that is not a multiple of
        :json-member:`downsample_factors`.
    downsample_factors:
      type: array

        type: integer
        minimum: 1
      description: |
        Factors by which to downsample each dimension of :json-member:`base`.
        The length must match the rank of :json-member:`base`.  Specifying a
        factor of 1 indicates not to downsample a given dimension.

        - [2, 2]

      - const: "stride"
        description: |
          Downsampling is performed by striding: reading a given position
          ``position`` in the downsampled view is exactly equivalent to
          reading ``position * downsample_factors`` in the original view.
          This method supports all data types and is quite efficient (there is
          no additional buffering of data).  It is equivalent to applying a
          striding index transform to :json-member:`base`; while it offers no
          additional functionality, it offers uniformity with other methods
          and may be simpler to specify.

          Note that striding is always with respect to an origin of 0 in all
          dimensions.  For example, downsampling a 1-dimensional TensorStore
          with a factor of 3 reads from positions ``0``, ``3``, ``6``, etc.
          To use a different offset, translate the domain of
          :json-member:`base`.
      - const: "median"
        description: |
          Downsampling computes the median value: reading a given ``position``
          in the downsampled view returns the median value within the
          rectangular region ``[position * downsample_factors, (position + 1)
          * downsample_factors)`` of the original view.  Only non-complex
          numeric data types and bool are supported.  The computed median
          value is always a value present in the original data.  In the case
          that the rectangular region contains an odd number of elements, the
          lower value is always used.  For example, the median computed for
          :json:`[4.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0]` is :json:`2.0`.
      - const: "mode"
        description: |
          Downsampling computes the mode (most frequent value): reading a
          given ``position`` in the downsampled view returns the mode within
          the rectangular region ``[position * downsample_factors, (position +
          1) * downsample_factors)`` of the original view.  All data types are
          supported.  In the case of a tie, for non-complex numeric data types
          and bool, the lowest value (among the set of common frequent values)
          is chosen.  For strings, the lexicographically smallest value is
          chosen.  For other data types, an unspecified (but deterministic for
          a given version of TensorStore) most frequent value is chosen.
      - const: "mean"
        description: |
          Downsampling is performed by arithmetic mean (averaging): reading a
          given ``position`` in the downsampled view returns the arithmetic
          mean within the rectangular region ``[position * downsample_factors,
          (position + 1) * downsample_factors)`` of the original view, where
          the average is computed only over positions that are within the
          bounds of the original view.  Only numeric data types and
          :json:`"bool"` are supported.  For integer data types, the means are
          computed exactly and rounded to the nearest integer, and rounded to
          even in the case of a tie.  For the :json:`"bool"` data type, the
          mode is chosen.

          Note that the blocks used for averaging start with an origin of 0 in
          all dimensions.  For example, downsampling a 1-dimensional
          TensorStore with a downsample factor of 3 averages the intervals
          ``[0, 3)``, ``[3, 6)``, ``[6, 9)``, etc.  To use a different offset,
          translate the domain of :json-member:`base`.
      - const: "min"
        description: |
          Downsampling computes the minimum value: reading a given
          ``position`` in the downsampled view returns the minimum value
          within the rectangular region ``[position * downsample_factors,
          (position + 1) * downsample_factors)`` of the original view.  Only
          non-complex numeric data types and bool are supported.
      - const: "max"
        description: |
          Downsampling computes the maximum value: reading a given
          ``position`` in the downsampled view returns the maximum value
          within the rectangular region ``[position * downsample_factors,
          (position + 1) * downsample_factors)`` of the original view.  Only
          non-complex numeric data types and bool are supported.
