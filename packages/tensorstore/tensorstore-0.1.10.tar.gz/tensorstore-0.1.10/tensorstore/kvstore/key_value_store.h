/// \file
/// Asynchronous key-value storage interface.
///
/// This file define the interface for using a KeyValueStore.  See `registry.h`
/// for the interface for defining a KeyValueStore driver.
///
/// There are three representations of a KeyValueStore that may be used for
/// different purposes:
///
/// 1. `KeyValueStore::Spec` specifies the parameters necessary to open/create a
///    `KeyValueStore`, including the driver id as well as any relevant
///    driver-specific options.  Parsing a `KeyValueStore::Spec` from JSON does
///    not involve any I/O and does not depend on a `Context` object.
///    Consequently, any references to context resources in the JSON
///    specification are left unresolved.
///
/// 2. `KeyValueStore::BoundSpec::Ptr` specifies the parameters and resources
///    necessary to open/create a `KeyValueStore` after resolving any resources
///    from a specified `Context`.  Converting from a `KeyValueStore::Spec` to a
///    `KeyValueStore::BoundSpec::Ptr` still does not involve any I/O, however.
///    In most cases it is unnecessary to work with the `BoundSpec`
///    representation directly, but it is useful for calculating a cache key
///    without actually opening the `KeyValueStore`, and for composition.
///
/// 3. `KeyValueStore::Ptr` is a handle to an open key value store that may be
///    used to perform reads and writes to the underlying key value store.  It
///    is opened asynchronously from a `KeyValueStore::BoundSpec::Ptr` or from a
///    `Context` and a `KeyValueStore::Spec` (and this open operation may
///    involve I/O).
///
/// The `KeyValueStore::Spec` and `KeyValueStore::BoundSpec::Ptr`
/// representations may be used to validate a JSON specification without
/// actually performing any I/O.
///
/// Example of opening directly:
///
///     Future<KeyValueStore::Ptr> store =
///         KeyValueStore::Open(Context::Default(), {"driver", "memory"});
///
/// Example of opening via `KeyValueStore::Spec`:
///
///     KeyValueStore::Spec::Ptr spec =
///         KeyValueStore::Spec::Ptr::FromJson({"driver", "memory"}).value();
///
///     Future<KeyValueStore::Ptr> store = spec->Open(Context::Default());
///
/// Example of opening via `KeyValueStore::Spec` and
/// `KeyValueStore::BoundSpec::Ptr`:
///
///     KeyValueStore::Spec::Ptr spec =
///         KeyValueStore::Spec::Ptr::FromJson({"driver", "memory"}).value();
///
///     KeyValueStore::BoundSpec::Ptr bound_spec =
///         spec->Bind(Context::Default()).value();
///
///     std::string store_cache_key;
///     internal::EncodeCacheKey(&store_cache_key, bound_spec);
///
///     // Compute derived cache key based on `store_cache_key`.  If already
///     // present in cache of opened objects, use existing object and return.
///
///     Future<KeyValueStore::Ptr> store = bound_spec->Open();
///
/// Some internal-only KeyValueStore implementations may not support
/// construction from a JSON specification.
