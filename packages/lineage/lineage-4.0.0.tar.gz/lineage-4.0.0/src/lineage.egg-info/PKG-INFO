        lineage
        =======
        ``lineage`` provides a framework for analyzing genotype (raw data) files from direct-to-consumer
        (DTC) DNA testing companies, primarily for the purposes of genetic genealogy.
        
        Capabilities
        ------------
        - Compute centiMorgans (cMs) of shared DNA between individuals using the HapMap Phase II genetic map
        - Plot shared DNA between individuals
        - Determine genes shared between individuals (i.e., genes transcribed from shared DNA segments)
        - Find discordant SNPs between child and parent(s)
        - Read, write, merge, and remaps SNPs for an individual via the  `snps <https://github.com/apriha/snps>`_ package
        
        Supported Genotype Files
        ------------------------
        ``lineage`` supports all genotype files supported by `snps <https://github.com/apriha/snps>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ``lineage`` is `available <https://pypi.org/project/lineage/>`_ on the
        `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`_. Install ``lineage`` (and its required
        Python dependencies) via ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install lineage
        
        Also see the `installation documentation <https://lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        ``lineage`` requires `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ 3.6.1+ and the following Python packages:
        
        - `numpy <https://numpy.org>`_
        - `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_
        - `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_
        - `atomicwrites <https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites>`_
        - `snps <https://github.com/apriha/snps>`_
        
        Examples
        --------
        Initialize the lineage Framework
        ````````````````````````````````
        Import ``Lineage`` and instantiate a ``Lineage`` object:
        
        >>> from lineage import Lineage
        >>> l = Lineage()
        
        Download Example Data
        `````````````````````
        First, let's setup logging to get some helpful output:
        
        >>> import logging, sys
        >>> logger = logging.getLogger()
        >>> logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        >>> logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout))
        
        Now we're ready to download some example data from `openSNP <https://opensnp.org>`_:
        
        >>> paths = l.download_example_datasets()
        Downloading resources/662.23andme.340.txt.gz
        Downloading resources/662.ftdna-illumina.341.csv.gz
        Downloading resources/663.23andme.305.txt.gz
        Downloading resources/4583.ftdna-illumina.3482.csv.gz
        Downloading resources/4584.ftdna-illumina.3483.csv.gz
        
        We'll call these datasets ``User662``, ``User663``, ``User4583``, and ``User4584``.
        
        Load Raw Data
        `````````````
        Create an ``Individual`` in the context of the ``lineage`` framework to interact with the
        ``User662`` dataset:
        
        >>> user662 = l.create_individual('User662', ['resources/662.23andme.340.txt.gz', 'resources/662.ftdna-illumina.341.csv.gz'])
        Loading SNPs('resources/662.23andme.340.txt.gz')
        Merging SNPs('resources/662.ftdna-illumina.341.csv.gz')
        SNPs('resources/662.ftdna-illumina.341.csv.gz') has Build 36; remapping to Build 37
        Downloading resources/NCBI36_GRCh37.tar.gz
        27 SNP positions were discrepant; keeping original positions
        151 SNP genotypes were discrepant; marking those as null
        
        Here we created ``user662`` with the name ``User662``. In the process, we merged two raw data
        files for this individual. Specifically:
        
        - ``662.23andme.340.txt.gz`` was loaded.
        - Then, ``662.ftdna-illumina.341.csv.gz`` was merged. In the process, it was found to have Build
          36. So, it was automatically remapped to Build 37 (downloading the remapping data in the
          process) to match the build of the SNPs already loaded. After this merge, 27 SNP positions and
          151 SNP genotypes were found to be discrepant.
        
        ``user662`` is represented by an ``Individual`` object, which inherits from ``snps.SNPs``.
        Therefore, all of the `properties and methods <https://snps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snps.html>`_
        available to a ``SNPs`` object are available here; for example:
        
        >>> len(user662.discrepant_merge_genotypes)
        151
        >>> user662.build
        37
        >>> user662.build_detected
        True
        >>> user662.assembly
        'GRCh37'
        >>> user662.count
        1006960
        
        As such, SNPs can be saved, remapped, merged, etc. See the
        `snps <https://github.com/apriha/snps>`_ package for further examples.
        
        Compare Individuals
        ```````````````````
        Let's create another ``Individual`` for the ``User663`` dataset:
        
        >>> user663 = l.create_individual('User663', 'resources/663.23andme.305.txt.gz')
        Loading SNPs('resources/663.23andme.305.txt.gz')
        
        Now we can perform some analysis between the ``User662`` and ``User663`` datasets.
        
        Find Discordant SNPs
        ''''''''''''''''''''
        First, let's find discordant SNPs (i.e., SNP data that is not consistent with Mendelian
        inheritance):
        
        >>> discordant_snps = l.find_discordant_snps(user662, user663, save_output=True)
        Saving output/discordant_snps_User662_User663_GRCh37.csv
        
        All `output files <https://lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output_files.html>`_ are saved to
        the output directory (a parameter to ``Lineage``).
        
        This method also returns a ``pandas.DataFrame``, and it can be inspected interactively at
        the prompt, although the same output is available in the CSV file.
        
        >>> len(discordant_snps.loc[discordant_snps['chrom'] != 'MT'])
        37
        
        Not counting mtDNA SNPs, there are 37 discordant SNPs between these two datasets.
        
        Find Shared DNA
        '''''''''''''''
        ``lineage`` uses the probabilistic recombination rates throughout the human genome from the
        `International HapMap Project <https://www.genome.gov/10001688/international-hapmap-project/>`_ to
        compute the shared DNA (in centiMorgans) between two individuals. Additionally, ``lineage``
        denotes when the shared DNA is shared on either one or both chromosomes in a pair. For example,
        when siblings share a segment of DNA on both chromosomes, they inherited the same DNA from their
        mother and father for that segment.
        
        With that background, let's find the shared DNA between the ``User662`` and ``User663`` datasets,
        calculating the centiMorgans of shared DNA and plotting the results:
        
        >>> results = l.find_shared_dna([user662, user663], cM_threshold=0.75, snp_threshold=1100)
        Downloading resources/genetic_map_HapMapII_GRCh37.tar.gz
        Downloading resources/cytoBand_hg19.txt.gz
        Saving output/shared_dna_User662_User663.png
        Saving output/shared_dna_one_chrom_User662_User663_GRCh37.csv
        
        Notice that the centiMorgan and SNP thresholds for each DNA segment can be tuned. Additionally,
        notice that two files were downloaded to facilitate the analysis and plotting - future analyses
        will use the downloaded files instead of downloading the files again. Finally, notice that a list
        of individuals is passed to ``find_shared_dna``... This list can contain an arbitrary number of
        individuals, and ``lineage`` will find shared DNA across all individuals in the list (i.e.,
        where all individuals share segments of DNA on either one or both chromosomes).
        
        Output is returned as a dictionary with the following keys (``pandas.DataFrame`` and
        ``pandas.Index`` items):
        
        >>> sorted(results.keys())
        ['one_chrom_discrepant_snps', 'one_chrom_shared_dna', 'one_chrom_shared_genes', 'two_chrom_discrepant_snps', 'two_chrom_shared_dna', 'two_chrom_shared_genes']
        
        In this example, there are 27 segments of shared DNA:
        
        >>> len(results['one_chrom_shared_dna'])
        27
        
        Also, `output files <https://lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output_files.html>`_ are
        created; these files are detailed in the documentation and their generation can be disabled with a
        ``save_output=False`` argument. In this example, the output files consist of a CSV file that
        details the shared segments of DNA on one chromosome and a plot that illustrates the shared DNA:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apriha/lineage/master/docs/images/shared_dna_User662_User663.png
        
        Find Shared Genes
        '''''''''''''''''
        The `Central Dogma of Molecular Biology <https://www.nature.com/nature/focus/crick/pdf/crick227.pdf>`_
        states that genetic information flows from DNA to mRNA to proteins: DNA is transcribed into
        mRNA, and mRNA is translated into a protein. It's more complicated than this (it's biology
        after all), but generally, one mRNA produces one protein, and the mRNA / protein is considered a
        gene.
        
        Therefore, it would be interesting to understand not just what DNA is shared between individuals,
        but what *genes* are shared between individuals *with the same variations*. In other words,
        what genes are producing the *same* proteins? [*]_ Since ``lineage`` can determine the shared DNA
        between individuals, it can use that information to determine what genes are also shared on
        either one or both chromosomes.
        
        .. [*] In theory, shared segments of DNA should be producing the same proteins, but there are many
         complexities, such as copy number variation (CNV), gene expression, etc.
        
        For this example, let's create two more ``Individuals`` for the ``User4583`` and ``User4584``
        datasets:
        
        >>> user4583 = l.create_individual('User4583', 'resources/4583.ftdna-illumina.3482.csv.gz')
        Loading SNPs('resources/4583.ftdna-illumina.3482.csv.gz')
        
        >>> user4584 = l.create_individual('User4584', 'resources/4584.ftdna-illumina.3483.csv.gz')
        Loading SNPs('resources/4584.ftdna-illumina.3483.csv.gz')
        
        Now let's find the shared genes:
        
        >>> results = l.find_shared_dna([user4583, user4584], shared_genes=True)
        Downloading resources/knownGene_hg19.txt.gz
        Downloading resources/kgXref_hg19.txt.gz
        Saving output/shared_dna_User4583_User4584.png
        Saving output/shared_dna_one_chrom_User4583_User4584_GRCh37.csv
        Saving output/shared_dna_two_chroms_User4583_User4584_GRCh37.csv
        Saving output/shared_genes_one_chrom_User4583_User4584_GRCh37.csv
        Saving output/shared_genes_two_chroms_User4583_User4584_GRCh37.csv
        
        The plot that illustrates the shared DNA is shown below. Note that in addition to outputting the
        shared DNA segments on either one or both chromosomes, the shared genes on either one or both
        chromosomes are also output.
        
        In this example, there are 15,976 shared genes on both chromosomes transcribed from 36 segments
        of shared DNA:
        
        >>> len(results['two_chrom_shared_genes'])
        15976
        >>> len(results['two_chrom_shared_dna'])
        36
