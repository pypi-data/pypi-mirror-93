Description: # Association-Metrics
        
        **Association-Metrics** is a Python module for measure the degree of association between variables built on top of SciPy and Numpy, and is distributed under the MIT license.
        
        The project started due to the lack of reliable source code to calculate [Cramers'v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r's_V), and from that, we decided to package-up our development. 
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Association-Metrics requires:
        
        * Python (>= 3.6)
        * NumPy (>= 1.13.3)
        * SciPy (>= 0.19.1)
        * Pandas (>= 1.2.1)
        
        
        ## User installation
        
        
        If you already have a working installation of numpy, scipy and pandas, the easiest way to install Association-Metrics is using `pip`
        
        `
        pip install association-metrics
        `
        
        ## Development
        
        We welcome new contributors of all experience levels.
