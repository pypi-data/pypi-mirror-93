Description: # portfolio-manager
        
        A simple tool for tracking and analysing the performance of investment portfolios.
        
        ## Features and Usage
        
        This package provides the user with the functionality to make deposits and withdrawals 
        of funds into one or more investment portfolios. The overall value of the portfolios 
        can be updated over time based on the market value of the underlying assets, and these 
        transactions are logged and saved.
        
        The package also contains various methods for calculating the rate of return of the 
        userâ€™s portfolios. These methods include a simple percentage return calculator and a 
        more sophisticated time-weighted return calculator.
        
        Example usage of the package can be found in the Jupyter Notebooks within 
        portfolio-manager/notebooks, in the GitHub repo (link below).
