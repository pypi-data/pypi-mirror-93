Description: # Zurich Instruments Drivers for QCoDeS (zhinst-qcodes)
        The Zurich Instruments drivers for QCoDeS (zhinst-qcodes) are a package of instrument drivers for devices produced by [Zurich Instruments](https://www.zhinst.com) for QCoDeS. [QCoDeS](http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes) is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed to serve the needs of nanoelectronic device experiments, but not limited to that. It is intended to be used within QCoDeS and not as standalone package. The QCoDeS instrument drivers are based on the [Zurich Instruments Toolkit](https://github.com/zhinst/zhinst-toolkit).
