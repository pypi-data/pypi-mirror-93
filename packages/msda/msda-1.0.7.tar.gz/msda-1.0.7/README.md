# MSDA 1.0.0

## What is MDSA?
MSDA is an open source `low-code` Multi-Sensor Data Analysis library in Python that aims to reduce the hypothesis to insights cycle time in a time-series multi-sensor data analysis & experiments. It enables users to perform end-to-end proof-of-concept experiments quickly and efficiently. The module identifies events in the multidimensional time series by capturing the variation and trend to establish relationship aimed towards identifying the correlated features helping in feature selection from raw sensor signals.


The package includes:-
1) Time series analysis.
2) The variation of each sensor column wrt time (increasing, decreasing, equal).
3) How each column values varies wrt other column, and the maximum variation ratio between each column wrt other column.
4) Relationship establishment with trend array to identify most appropriate sensor.
5) User can select window length and then check average value and standard deviation across each window for each sensor column.
6) It provides count of growth/decay value for each sensor column values above or below a threshold value.
7) Feature Engineering 
    a) Features involving trend of values across various aggregation windows: change and rate of change in average, std. deviation across window.
    b) Ratio of changes, growth rate with std. deviation.
    c) Change over time.
    d) Rate of change over time.
    e) Growth or decay.
    f) Rate of growth or decay.
    g) Count of values above or below a threshold value.


MSDA is `simple`, `easy to use` and `low-code`.
