:warning: Checkout [`develop`](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/tree/develop) branch to see what is coming in `pyannote.audio` 2.0:

- a much smaller and cleaner codebase
- Python-first API (the *good old* pyannote-audio CLI will still be available, though)
- multi-GPU and TPU training thanks to [pytorch-lightning](https://pytorchlightning.ai/)
- data augmentation with [torch-audiomentations](https://github.com/asteroid-team/torch-audiomentations)
- [huggingface](https://huggingface.co) model hosting
- [prodigy](https://prodi.gy) recipes for audio annotations
- online [demo](https://share.streamlit.io/pyannote/pyannote-audio-demo/main/app.py) based on [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io)

# Neural speaker diarization with `pyannote-audio`

`pyannote.audio` is an open-source toolkit written in Python for speaker diarization. Based on [PyTorch](pytorch.org) machine learning framework, it provides a set of trainable end-to-end neural building blocks that can be combined and jointly optimized to build speaker diarization pipelines:

`pyannote.audio` also comes with [pretrained models](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio-hub) covering a wide range of domains for voice activity detection, speaker change detection, overlapped speech detection, and speaker embedding:

## Installation

`pyannote.audio` only supports Python 3.7 (or later) on Linux and macOS. It might work on Windows but there is no garantee that it does, nor any plan to add official support for Windows.

The instructions below assume that `pytorch` has been installed using the instructions from https://pytorch.org.


```bash
$ pip install pyannote.audio==1.1.1
```
