    Adds a ``rabbitmq_use_3_7_24_on_centos7`` flag which can be set to ``true``
    to deploy the ``rabbitmq-3.7.24`` image on CentOS 7. The image should be
    deployed via ``kolla-ansible upgrade``, and can be used to provide a
    RabbitMQ cluster that is compatible with the CentOS 8 ``rabbitmq`` image.
