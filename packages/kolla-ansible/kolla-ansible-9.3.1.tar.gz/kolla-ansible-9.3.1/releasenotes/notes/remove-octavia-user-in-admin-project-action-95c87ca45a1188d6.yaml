upgrade:
  - |
    The octavia user is no longer given the admin role in the admin
    project. Octavia does not require this role and instead uses octavia
    user with admin role in service project. During an upgrade the octavia
    user is removed from the admin project. See
    `bug 1873176 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1873176>`__
    for details.
