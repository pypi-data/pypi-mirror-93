    Fixes an issue where ``openstack_release`` was set to ``master`` by
    default, resulting in containers tagged ``master`` being deployed. It has
    been changed to ``train``. The same applies to ``kolla_source_version``,
    which affects development mode. See `bug 1866054
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1866054>`__ for details.
