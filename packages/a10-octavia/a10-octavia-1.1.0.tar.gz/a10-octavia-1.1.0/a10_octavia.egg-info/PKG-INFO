        ## Overview
        
        **This solution is currently in beta stage with limited support**
        
        The A10 Networks Octavia Driver allows for configuration of Thunder, vThunder, and AX Series Appliances deployed in
        an Openstack enviroment. While the default Octavia provider leverages an "Amphora per VIP" architecture,
        this provider driver uses a "Thunder per Tenant" architecture. Therefore, each tenant may only be serviced by a single
        **active** Thunder device.
