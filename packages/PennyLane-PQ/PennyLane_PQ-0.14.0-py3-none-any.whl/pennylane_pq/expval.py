Expectations
############

.. currentmodule:: pennylane_pq.expval

In addition to the suitable default operations native to PennyLane,
the devices of the ProjectQ plugin support a number of additional expectations
that can be used alongside the native PennyLane expectations when defining
quantum functions:

.. autosummary::
   .. AllPauliZ
"""

# from pennylane.operation import Expectation

# class AllPauliZ(Expectation):
#     r"""Measure Pauli Z on all qubits.

#     .. math:: AllPauliZ = \sigma_z \otimes\dots\otimes \sigma_z

#     """
#     num_params = 0
#     num_wires = 0
#     par_domain = None
