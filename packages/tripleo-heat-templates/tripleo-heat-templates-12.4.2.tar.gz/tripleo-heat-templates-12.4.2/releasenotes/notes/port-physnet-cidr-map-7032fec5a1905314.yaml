    Added the parameter ``PortPhysnetCidrMap`` in the ironic inspector service
    template. The parameter takes a mapping of IP subnet CIDR to physical
    network. When the ``physnet_cidr_map`` processing hook is enabled the
    physical_network property of baremetal ports is populated based on this
    mapping. See Bug: `1870529 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1870529>`_.
