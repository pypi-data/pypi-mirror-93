deprecations:
  - |
    Usage of the option ``NeutronFirewallDriver`` which was used to set
    ``firewall_driver`` config option in the Neutron server's config is now
    deprecated.
    Firewall driver should be set per agent in the agent's config.
    It can be done using ``NeutronOVSFirewallDriver`` option.
    Option in the Neutron server was in there just for backward
    compatybility reasons but since Newton release all Neutron agents are
    reporting to the server what firewall driver is used so there is no need to
    keep this legacy, server side option anymore.
