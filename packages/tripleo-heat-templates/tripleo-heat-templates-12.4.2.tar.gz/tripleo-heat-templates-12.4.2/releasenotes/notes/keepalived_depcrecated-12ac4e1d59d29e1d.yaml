deprecations:
  - |
    KeepalivedRestart is deprecated and has no effect. The workaround isn't
    needed anymore since we now deploy keepalived-2.0.10-4.
    This version has support for 'dynamic_interfaces' which is required when
    the network config was changed and os-net-config restarts the network
    interface.
