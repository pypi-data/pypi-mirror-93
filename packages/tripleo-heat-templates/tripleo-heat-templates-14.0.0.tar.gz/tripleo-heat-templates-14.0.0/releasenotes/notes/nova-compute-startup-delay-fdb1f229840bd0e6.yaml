    The parameter ``NovaComputeStartupDelay`` allows the operator to delay the
    startup of ``nova-compute`` after a compute node reboot.
    When all the overcloud nodes are rebooted at the same time, it can take a
    few minutes to the Ceph cluster to get in a healthy state. This delay will
    prevent the instances from booting before the Ceph cluster is healthy.
