    Provides the option to set the "ovn_emit_need_to_frag" configuration
    option to the "ovn" section of etc/neutron/plugins/ml2_conf.ini. This
    option tells ovn whether it should emit ICMP "need to frag" packets
    in case of MTU mismatch. Before enabling this configuration make
    sure that it's supported by the host kernel (version >= 5.2) or
    by checking the output of the following command 'ovs-appctl -t
    ovs-vswitchd dpif/show-dp-features br-int | grep "Check pkt length
    action"'. Defaults to False.
