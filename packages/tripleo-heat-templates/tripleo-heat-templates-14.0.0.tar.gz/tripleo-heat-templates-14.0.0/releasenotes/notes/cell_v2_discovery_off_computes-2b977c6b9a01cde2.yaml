    Cell_v2 discovery has been moved from the nova-compute|nova-ironic
    containers as this requires nova api database credentials which must
    not be configured for the nova-compute service.
    As a result scale-up deployments which explicitly omit the Controller
    nodes will need to make alternative arrangements to run cell_v2 discovery.
    Either the nova-manage command can be run manually after scale-up, or
    an additional helper node using the NovaManage role can be deployed that
    will be used for this task instead of a Controller node. See Bug:
    `1786961 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1786961>`_ and Bug:
    `1871482 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1871482>`_.
