    The parameter ``NetworkDeletionPolicy`` (defaults to: ``delete``) was added
    to enable control of the ``deletion_policy`` for overcloud network
    resources (networks, segments and subnets). By setting the parameter to
    ``retain`` the physical resources will not be deleted if removed from the
    heat templates, or the stack is deleted.
