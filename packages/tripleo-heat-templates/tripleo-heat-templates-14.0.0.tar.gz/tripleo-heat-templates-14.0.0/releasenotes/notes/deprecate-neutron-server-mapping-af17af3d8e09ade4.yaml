deprecations:
  - |
    The OS::TripleO::Services::NeutronServer service mapping is deprecated in
    favor of using OS::TripleO::Services::NeutronApi. Any role definitions
    still using OS::TripleO::Services::NeutronServer need to either be updated
    to use OS::TripleO::Services::NeutronApi instead, or they can make use of
    the environment file at environments/services/neutron-server.yaml to enable
    the old mapping. The environment file will be removed in the ussuri
    release.
