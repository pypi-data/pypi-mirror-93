upgrade:
  - |
    The `EnableEtcdInternalTLS` parameter's default value changes from false
    to true. The change is related to the fact that novajoin is deprecated,
    and the functionality associated with the `EnableEtcdInternalTLS` parameter
    is not required when TLS is deployed using the tripleo-ansible ansible
    module.
deprecations:
  - |
    The `EnableEtcdInternalTLS` parameter is deprecated. It was added to support
    a workaround that is necessary when novajoin is used to deploy TLS, but
    novajoin itself is deprecated. The workaround is not necessary when TLS
    is deployed using the tripleo-ansible ansible module.
