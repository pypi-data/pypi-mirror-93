    When deploying a spine-and-leaf (L3 routed architecture) with TLS enabled
    for internal endpoints the deployment would fail because some roles are
    not connected to the network mapped to the service in ServiceNetMap. To
    fix this issue a role specific parameter ``{{role.name}}ServiceNetMap`` is
    introduced (defaults to: ``{}``). The role specific ServiceNetMap parameter
    allow the operator to override one or more service network mappings
    per-role. For example::

      ComputeLeaf2ServiceNetMap:
        NovaLibvirtNetwork: internal_api_leaf2

    The role specific ``{{role.name}}ServiceNetMap`` override is merged with
    the global ``ServiceNetMap`` when it's passed as a value to the
    ``{{role.name}}ServiceChain`` resources, and the ``{{role.name}}``
    resource groups so that the correct network for this role is mapped to
    the service.
