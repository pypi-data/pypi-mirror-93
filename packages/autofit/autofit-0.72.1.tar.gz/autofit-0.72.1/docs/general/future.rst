The following features are planned for 2021 - 2022:

- **Message Passing** - Composing complex models from many model components using Bayes factors and fitting them within a message passing framework.

- **Time series modelling** - Fit temporally varying models using fits which marginalize over time.

- **Approximate Bayesian Computation** - Likelihood-free modeling.
