# This command runs the bandit security linter against the openstackclient
# codebase minus the tests directory. Some tests are being excluded to
# reduce the number of positives before a team inspection, and to ensure a
# passing gate job for initial addition. The excluded tests are:
# B105-B107: hardcoded password checks - likely to generate false positives
#            in a gate environment
# B401: import subprocess - not necessarily a security issue; this plugin is
#       mainly used for penetration testing workflow
# B603,B606: process without shell - not necessarily a security issue; this
#            plugin is mainly used for penetration testing workflow
# B607: start process with a partial path - this should be a project level
#       decision
# NOTE(elmiko): The following tests are being excluded specifically for
# python-openstackclient, they are being excluded to ensure that voting jobs
# in the project and in bandit integration tests continue to pass. These
# tests have generated issue within the project and should be investigated
# by the project.
# B110: try, except, pass detected - possible security issue; this should be
#       investigated by the project for possible exploitation
# B605: process with a shell - possible security issue; this should be
#       investigated by the project for possible exploitation
# B101: use of assert - this code will be removed when compiling to optimized
#       byte code
