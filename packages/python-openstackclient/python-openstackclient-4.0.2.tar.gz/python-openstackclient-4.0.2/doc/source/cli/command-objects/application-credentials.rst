With application credentials, a user can grant their applications limited
access to their cloud resources. Once created, users can authenticate with an
application credential by using the ``v3applicationcredential`` auth type.

application credential create
-----------------------------

Create new application credential

.. program:: application credential create

        [--expiration <expiration>]
        [--description <description>]
        [--restricted|--unrestricted]
        <name>

.. option:: --secret <secret>

.. option:: --description <description>

    Application credential description

.. option:: --unrestricted

    Enable application credential to create and delete other application
    credentials and trusts (this is potentially dangerous behavior and is
    disabled by default)

    application credentials and trusts (this is the default behavior)

-----------------------------
