A solved Sudoku puzzle\nis nothing more than a Cayley table of a quasigroup from 9 items with\nsome well-known additional properties. So, one can imagine a puzzle\nmade from a Cayley table of any other magma, e. g. a semigroup, by\nhiding part of its cells.\n\nThere are two major differences between sudoku and puzzles based on\nsemigroups:\n\n1) it's easy to take a glance on a table to understand whether it is\na sudoku or not. That's why it was possible to encode numbers in a\ntable cells as colour intensities. Sudoku is a picture, and a\nsemigroup is not. It's difficult to check a Cayley table's\nassociativity with a naked eye;\n\n2) sudoku puzzles are solved by humans for fun and thus catalogued.\nWhen solving a sudoku one knows for sure that there is a unique\nsolution. On the contrary, nobody guesses values in a partially\nfilled Cayley table of a semigroup as a form of amusement. As a\nresult, one can create a puzzle from a full Cayley table of a\nsemigroup but there may be many distinct solutions.\n",
