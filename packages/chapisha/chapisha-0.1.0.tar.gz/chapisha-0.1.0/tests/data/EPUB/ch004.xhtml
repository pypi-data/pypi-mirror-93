<h1>Author’s note</h1>
<p>I enjoyed revisiting the world I explored in my first novel, <em>Lament for the Fallen</em>. Ewuru feels a very gentle place when set against the context of 2017.</p>
<p>This short story serves as both a stand-alone companion to the novel’s paperback release on 1 June 2017, and as a bridge between my first and third novels. No prizes for what that story will be about.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about ndem-worship in Efik culture, you should visit the Efik Eburutu website at <a href="http://efikeburutu.org">http://efikeburutu.org</a> where you will find a wealth of information on their traditions and history. The ceremony and song in <em>Usan Abasi’s Lament</em> are sourced from there.</p>
<p>And, as always, a song to complement the tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Sirata’, Ma Ya – Habib Koité [<em>Usan Abasi’s Lament</em>]</p>
