## Overview

The curves package contains a set of tools for building commodity forward, swaps, and futures curves.

More specifically, the problem being solved is to take a collection of traded forward prices, and tranform these into a 
forward curve of homogenous granularity. Additionally the derived curve can constructed to be in a granularity higher 
than what is traded in the market.

Examples of types of curve which can be constructed using this package:
* Monthly granularity oil products swap curves from traded monthly, quarterly, and calendar yearly granularity
market swap rates.
* Daily granularity natural gas forward curves from traded daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, seasonal, and
gas year granularity forward and futures prices.
* Half-hourly granularity power forward curves from traded daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and seasonal
granularity forward and futures prices.

The resulting curves should be consistent with inputs, in that they average back to the input forward contract prices.
This is a necessary to ensure that there are no arbitrage opportunities introduced between input contracts, and the derived forward curve.

## Usage
Two functions in the curves package are the core of the curve building calculations; bootstrap_contracts and max_smooth_interp.
Some basic examples of both of these function are given below. Both of these methods make extensive use of pandas, with
the pandas.Series type used to represent forward curves, and pandas.Period for the delivery period of an input forward contract
or derived forward curve.

For details of more advanced usage, view the docstrings for either of these functions and the Jupyter Notebook [curves_tutorial](https://github.com/cmdty/curves/blob/master/samples/python/curves_tutorial.ipynb).

### Bootstrapper
The basic functionality of the method bootstrap_contracts is to take a set of forward prices, for contracts with overlapping 
delivery/fixing periods, and return a curve with overlapping periods removed, but with prices consistent with the original inputs.
Below is a basic example showing prices for January and Q1 delivery period periods being bootstrapped into 
consistent January, February and March forward prices.

```python
from curves import bootstrap_contracts
from datetime import date

q1_price = 19.05
contracts = [
    (date(2019, 1, 1), 18.95), # Jan-19
    (date(2019, 1, 1), date(2019, 3, 1), 19.05) # Q1-19
]
piecewise_curve, bootstrapped_contracts = bootstrap_contracts(contracts, freq='M')
print(piecewise_curve)
print()
for bc in bootstrapped_contracts:
    print("{0}, {1}, {2:.3f}".format(repr(bc.start), repr(bc.end), bc.price))

```

The above code prints to the following:
```
2019-01    18.950000
2019-02    19.102542
2019-03    19.102542
Freq: M, dtype: float64

Period('2019-01', 'M'), Period('2019-01', 'M'), 18.950
Period('2019-02', 'M'), Period('2019-03', 'M'), 19.103
```

### Spline Interpolation
In order to facility creating a curve with higher granularity than the input contracts, the curves package includes the max_smooth_interp function. 
This uses a maximum smoothness algorithm to interpolate input contracts with a fourth-order spline, whilst maintaining the average price constraints 
inherent in the input contract prices.

The example below creates a daily granularity curve, from input contracts of various granularities. As would usually be the case in a practical scenario, 
the bootstrap_contracts method is first used to remove the overlaps from the contracts. The example below also shows how the input contracts can have gaps 
between them, which the spline will interpolate over, filling in the gaps in the final smooth curve. It also demonstrates the different ways of representing 
the contract delivery period in the contract tuples and use of the helper module contract_period.

```python
from curves import max_smooth_interp
from curves import contract_period as cp

contracts = [
    (date(2019, 5, 31), 34.875), 
    (date(2019, 6, 1), date(2019, 6, 2), 32.87),
    ((date(2019, 6, 3), date(2019, 6, 9)), 32.14),
    (pd.Period(year=2019, month=6, freq='M'), 31.08),
    (cp.month(2019, 7), 29.95),
    (cp.q_3(2019), 30.18),
    (cp.q_4(2019), 37.64),
    (cp.winter(2019), 38.05),
    (cp.summer(2020), 32.39),
    (cp.winter(2020), 37.84),
    (cp.gas_year(2020), 35.12)
]

pc_for_spline, bc_for_spline = bootstrap_contracts(contracts, freq='D')
smooth_curve = max_smooth_interp(bc_for_spline, freq='D')

print(smooth_curve)
```

The above code prints to the following:

### Curve Granularity
The granularity of the derived curves is controlled by the string passed in as the freq parameter. For returned values 
which are of type pandas.Series, this parameter is used when constructing these objects, with more details on the these 
frequency strings found in the pandas documentation 
[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#dateoffset-objects).
The package level dict variable FREQ_TO_PERIOD_TYPE contains a mapping between freq parameter values and the underlying 
managed types from the [.NET Time Period Library](https://github.com/cmdty/time-period-value-types) used to represent 
the resulting curve index type, and hence granularity. As such, the keys of 
FREQ_TO_PERIOD_TYPE can be used to determine the set of admissible values for the freq parameter.

```python
from curves import FREQ_TO_PERIOD_TYPE
FREQ_TO_PERIOD_TYPE
```
Displays the following:
```
{'15min': Cmdty.TimePeriodValueTypes.QuarterHour,
 '30min': Cmdty.TimePeriodValueTypes.HalfHour,
 'H': Cmdty.TimePeriodValueTypes.Hour,
 'D': Cmdty.TimePeriodValueTypes.Day,
 'M': Cmdty.TimePeriodValueTypes.Month,
 'Q': Cmdty.TimePeriodValueTypes.Quarter}
```
