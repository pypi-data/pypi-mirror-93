    Creates a function which returns a float based on the day of week of it's parameter. 

    Args:
        default (float): The default value returned by the returned function.
        monday (float, optional): The value that the returned function returns when it's parameter represents a Monday.
        tuesday (float, optional): The value that the returned function returns when it's parameter represents a Tuesday.
        wednesday (float, optional): The value that the returned function returns when it's parameter represents a Wednesday.
        thursday (float, optional): The value that the returned function returns when it's parameter represents a Thursday.
        friday (float, optional): The value that the returned function returns when it's parameter represents a Friday.
        saturday (float, optional): The value that the returned function returns when it's parameter represents a Saturday.
        sunday (float, optional): The value that the returned function returns when it's parameter represents a Sunday.

    Returns:
        callable: Callable accepting a single parameter of type pandas.Period and returning a float. The value 
            that the returned function will return depends on the dayofweek attribute of the parameter. If any of the
            parameters monday/tuesday/wednesday etc have been provided, then the value of the parameter which 
            matches the Period day of week will be returned. Otherwise the value provided as the default
            parameter will be returned.
