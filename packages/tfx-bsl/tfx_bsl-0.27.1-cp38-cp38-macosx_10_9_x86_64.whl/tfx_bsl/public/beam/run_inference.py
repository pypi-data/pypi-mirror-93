  """Run inference with a model.

   There are two types of inference you can perform using this PTransform:
   1. In-process inference from a SavedModel instance. Used when
     `saved_model_spec` field is set in `inference_spec_type`.
   2. Remote inference by using a service endpoint. Used when
     `ai_platform_prediction_model_spec` field is set in
     `inference_spec_type`.

  TODO(b/131873699): Add support for the following features:
  1. Bytes as Input.
  2. PTable Input.
  3. Models as SideInput.

  Args:
    examples: A PCollection containing examples.
    inference_spec_type: Model inference endpoint.

  Returns:
    A PCollection containing prediction logs.
