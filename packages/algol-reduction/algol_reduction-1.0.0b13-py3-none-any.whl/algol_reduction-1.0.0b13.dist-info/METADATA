Welcome to reduction's documentation!
=====================================

*Note: currently scipy dependency is restricted to version 1.4.1.
Versions 1.5.0 to 1.5.4 contain a bug in the fitting algorithms.*

This library was created to apply doppler tomography to the Algol star system.
This is still the main purpose for most of the code.

However, some parts are generic and can be used for any spectrum and star.
This includes:

- flux normalization using synthetic spectra::

   normalize_spectrum --help

  Some example synthetic spectra from the Pollux database are included
  in the source distribution of the package.

- planing observations of variable stars::

   plan_observations --help

  This scripts generates `ics` file you can import into your calenders.

- display spectra::

   fits_display1d --help

- manipulate fits header::

   fits_setval --help

- loading spectra from fits and text files

- measuring absorption or emission profiles
