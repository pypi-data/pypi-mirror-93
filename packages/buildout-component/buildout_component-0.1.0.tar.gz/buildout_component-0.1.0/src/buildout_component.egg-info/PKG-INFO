Description: # buildout-component
        
        Python Buildout component tool, a tool program used to help componentize the settings of zc.buildout.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Buildout is a great tool for Python development and deployment environment, but it requires a lot of settings to work
        well.
        
        I am used to Buildout each reusable item as a component. If there is a component that needs to be reused, just copy its
        content to a new project to use it directly, but it still depends on manual settings and configuration.
        
        In order to simplify the complicated settings, I wrote a gadget called `buildout-component` to help me set up the
        componentized environment of Buildout more conveniently.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Generate the file structure of Buildout Component;
        - Through the question and answer method, to generate the Buildout profile.

        - Display set value
        
                $ buildout-component show-options
