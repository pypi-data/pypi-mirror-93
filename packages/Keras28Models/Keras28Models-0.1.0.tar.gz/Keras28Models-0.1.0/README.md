# Keras28 Models 

This is a Python package for easy build deep learning applications by using transfer learning  pre trainined 28 models in easy few line code. to avoid wasting time scripting in your deep learning .You can read about keras models in complex code scriptining [keras document for Models API](https://keras.io/api/)
.that is easy code for  training your custom dataset in faster code not complex scripting code. more than 25% of time spent on deep learning  projects is collecting and cleaning data 
and building convolution neural network (CNN)..but this package is very easy for images classifiction and recognition application and save final weights models .and compare all pre trainined models results for choice  the best accurecy one
convert results to DataFrame for easy viewing...(CSV format file spreadsheet) contains model name and number model parameters and validation accurcy ..and final code it is plot the num model params vs validation_accuracy for choosing benchmark
