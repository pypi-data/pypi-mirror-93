        # General
        This module contains functions to decode and parse Automatic Identification System (AIS) serial messages.
        For detailed information about AIS refer to the [AIS standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system#Message_format).
        
        # Usage
        Using this module is easy. If you want to parse a file, that contains AIS messages, just copy the following code and replace `filename` with your desired filename.
        
        ```python
        from pyais import FileReaderStream
        
        filename = "sample.ais"
        
        for msg in FileReaderStream(filename):
            decoded_message = msg.decode()
            ais_content = decoded_message.content
        ```
        
        It is possible to directly convert messages into JSON.
        
        ```python
        from pyais import TCPStream
        
        for msg in TCPStream('ais.exploratorium.edu'):
            json_data = msg.decode().to_json()
        ```
        
        
        You can also parse a single message encoded as bytes or from a string:
        ```python
        message = NMEAMessage(b"!AIVDM,1,1,,B,15M67FC000G?ufbE`FepT@3n00Sa,0*5C")
        message = NMEAMessage.from_string("!AIVDM,1,1,,B,15M67FC000G?ufbE`FepT@3n00Sa,0*5C")
        ```
        
        See the example folder for more examples.
        
        Another common use case is the reception of messages via UDP.
        This lib comes with an `UDPStream` class that enables just that. 
        This stream class also handles out-of-order delivery of messages, which can occur when using UDP.
        
        ```py
        from pyais.stream import UDPStream
        
        host = "127.0.0.1"
        port = 55555
        
        for msg in UDPStream(host, port):
            msg.decode()
            # do something with it
        
        ```
        
        I also wrote a [blog post about AIS decoding](https://leonrichter.de/posts/pyais/) and this lib. 
        
        # Performance Considerations
        You may refer to the [Code Review Stack Exchange question](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/230258/decoding-of-binary-data-ais-from-socket).
        After a some research I decided to use the bitarray module as foundation.
        This module uses a C extension under the hood and has a nice user interface in Python.
        Performance is also great.
        Decoding this [sample](https://www.aishub.net/ais-dispatcher) with roughly 85k messages takes **less than 6 seconds** on my machine.
        For comparison, the C++ based [libais module](https://github.com/schwehr/libais) parses the same file in \~ 2 seconds. 
        
        # Disclaimer
        This module is a private project of mine and does not claim to be complete. I try to improve and extend it, but there may be bugs. If you find such a bug feel free to submit an issue or even better create a pull-request. :-)
        
        # Coverage
        Currently this module is able to decode most message types. There are only a few exceptions. These are messages that only occur in very rare cases and that you will probably never observe. The module was able to completely decode a 4 hour stream with real-time data from San Francisco Bay Area without any errors or problems. If you find a bug or missing feature, please create an issue.
        
        
        # Known Issues
        
        During installation, you may encounter problems due to missing header files. The error looks like this:
        
        ````sh
        ...
        
            bitarray/_bitarray.c:13:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
               13 | #include "Python.h"
                  |          ^~~~~~~~~~
            compilation terminated.
            error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
        
        ...
        
        ````
        
        In  order to solve this issue, you need to install header files and static libraries for python dev:
        
        ````sh
        $ sudo apt install python3-dev
        ````
        
        
        # For developers
        After you cloned the repo head into the `pyais` base directory.
        
        Then install all dependencies:
        
        ```sh
        $ make init
        ```
        
        Make sure that all tests pass and that there aren't any issues:
        
        ```sh
        $ make test
        ```
        
        Now you are ready to start developing on the project! Don't forget to add tests for every new change or feature!
