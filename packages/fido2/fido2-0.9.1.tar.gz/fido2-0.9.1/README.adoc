Provides library functionality for communicating with a FIDO device over USB as
well as verifying attestation and assertion signatures.

WARNING: This project is in beta. Expect things to change or break at any time!

WARNING: Version 0.9 is the last planned version of this library which will
support Python 2. The next major version planned is 1.0, which will require
Python 3 or later.

This library aims to support the FIDO U2F and FIDO 2.0 protocols for
communicating with a USB authenticator via the Client-to-Authenticator Protocol
(CTAP 1 and 2). In addition to this low-level device access, classes defined in
the `fido2.client` and `fido2.server` modules implement higher level operations
which are useful when interfacing with an Authenticator, or when implementing
WebAuthn support for a Relying Party.

For usage, see the `examples/` directory.

=== Requirements
fido2 is compatible with CPython 2.7 (2.7.6 and up), 3.5 onwards, and is tested
on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Support for OpenBSD and FreeBSD is provided as-is
and relies on community contributions.


=== Installation
fido2 is installable by running the following command:

  pip install fido2

To install the dependencies required for communication with NFC Authenticators,
instead use:

  pip install fido2[pcsc]

Under Windows 10 (1903 or later) access to FIDO devices is restricted and
requires running as Administrator. This library can still be used when running
as non-administrator, via the  `fido.client.WindowsClient` class. An example of
this is included in the file `examples/credential.py`.

Under Linux you will need to add a Udev rule to be able to access the FIDO
device, or run as root. For example, the Udev rule may contain the following:

----
#Udev rule for allowing HID access to Yubico devices for FIDO support.

KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", \
  MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050"
----

Under FreeBSD you will either need to run as root or add rules for your device
to /etc/devd.conf, which can be automated by installing security/u2f-devd:

  # pkg install u2f-devd


=== Dependencies
This project depends on Cryptography. For instructions on installing this
dependency, see https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/.

NFC support is optionally available via PCSC, using the pyscard library. For
instructions on installing this dependency, see
https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/pyscard/blob/master/INSTALL.md.


=== Development
For development of the library, we recommend using `pipenv`. To set up the dev
environment, run this command in the root directory of the repository:

  pipenv install --dev


==== Running tests
While many tests can run on their own, some require a connected U2F or FIDO2
device to run.

  pipenv run test
