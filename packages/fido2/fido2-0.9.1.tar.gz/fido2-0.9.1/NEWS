* Version 0.9.1 (released 2021-02-03)
 ** Add new CTAP error codes and improve handling of unknown codes.

* Version 0.9.0 (released 2021-01-20)
 ** Server: Attestation is now done in two parts (to align better with the spec):
    First, type-specific validation is done to provide a trust chain.
    Second, validation of the trust chain is done.
 ** Client: API changes to better support extensions.
  *** Fido2Client can be configured with Ctap2Extensions to support.
  *** Client.make_credential now returns a AuthenticatorAttestationResponse,
      which holds the AttestationObject and ClientData, as well as any client
      extension results for the credential.
  *** Client.get_assertion now returns an AssertionSelection object, which is
      used to select between multiple assertions, resulting in an
      AuthenticatorAssertionResponse, which holds the ClientData, assertion
      values, as well as any client extension results for the assertion.
 ** Renames: The CTAP1 and CTAP2 classes have been renamed to Ctap1 and Ctap2,
    respectively. The old names currently work, but will be removed in the
    future.
 ** ClientPin: The ClientPin API has been restructured to support multiple PIN
    protocols, UV tokens, and token permissions.
 ** CTAP 2.1 PRE: Several new features have been added for CTAP 2.1, including
    Credential Management, Bio Enrollment, Large Blobs, and Authenticator Config.
 ** HID: The platform specific HID code has been revamped and cleaned up.

* Version 0.8.1 (released 2019-11-25)

    unspecified.

* Version 0.8.0 (released 2019-11-25)
 ** New fido2.webauthn classes modeled after the W3C WebAuthn spec introduced.
 ** CTAP2 send_cbor/make_credential/get_assertion  and U2fClient
    request/authenticate `timeout` arguments replaced with `event` used to
    cancel a request.
 ** Fido2Client:
  *** make_credential/get_assertion now take WebAuthn options objects.
  *** timeout is now provided in ms in WebAuthn options objects. Event based
      cancelation also available by passing an Event.
 ** Fido2Server:
  *** ATTESTATION, USER_VERIFICATION, and AUTHENTICATOR_ATTACHMENT enums
      have been replaced with fido2.webauthn classes.
  *** RelyingParty has been replaced with PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity, and
      name is no longer optional.
  *** Options returned by register_begin/authenticate_begin now omit unspecified
      values if they are optional, instead of filling in default values.
  *** Fido2Server.allowed_algorithms now contains a list of
      PublicKeyCredentialParameters instead of algorithm identifiers.
  *** Fido2Server.timeout is now in ms and of type int.
 ** Support native WebAuthn API on Windows through WindowsClient.
