Description: # Sensapex SDK
        
        This python library wraps the C SDK provided by Sensapex's umsdk. It provides
        general access to the functions present therein, as well as a device-based
        abstraction.
        
        ### Installation
        
        `pip install sensapex`
        
        Download [the latest umsdk library](http://dist.sensapex.com/misc/um-sdk/rc/) for your platform.
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```python
        from sensapex import UMP
        
        UMP.set_library_path("/path/which/contains/umsdk/binary/for/your/platform/")
        ump = UMP.get_ump()
        ump.list_devices()
        
        stage = ump.get_device(1)
        stage.calibrate_zero_position()
        
        manipulator = ump.get_device(4)
        manipulator.goto_pos((-2500.0412, 6810.0003, 15830.1419), speed=2)
        
        pressure = ump.get_device(30)
        pressure.set_pressure(1, 2.3e-4)
        ```
        
        Also included are some simple sanity checks. The following will report on all 
        devices present:
        
        ```bash
        python -m sensapex.test
        ```
        
        Or for a more involved test of your hardware as it moves around randomly,
        install [pyqtgraph](https://pyqtgraph.org) in your environment and use e.g.:
        
        ```bash
        STAGE_DEVID=1
        python -m sensapex.accuracy_test $STAGE_DEVID
        ```
