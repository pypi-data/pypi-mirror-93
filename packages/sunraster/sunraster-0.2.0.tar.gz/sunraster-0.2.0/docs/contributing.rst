Contributing to sunraster
=========================

We are always enthusiastic to welcome new users and developers who want
to enhance the ``sunraster``.
You can contribute in several ways, from providing feedback, reporting bugs,
contributing code, and reviewing pull requests.
There is a role for almost any level of engagement.

Providing Feedback
------------------

We could always use more voices and opinions in the discussions about
``sunraster`` and its development from both users and developers.
There are a number of ways to make your voice heard.
Whether it be constructive criticism, inquiries about current or
future capabilities, or flattering praise, we would love to hear from you.
You can contact us on the SunPy matrix channel or SunPy mailing lists.
See :ref:`getting_help`.

.. _reporting_bugs:

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you run into unexpected behavior or a bug please report it.
All bugs are raised and stored on our `issue tracker`_.
If you are not sure if your problem is a bug, a deficiency in functionality,
or something else, send us a message on the SunPy chat room or an email
to the developer mailing list. Ideally, we would like a short code example
so we can run into the bug on our own machines. See :ref:`getting_help`.

.. _contributing_code:

Contributing Code
-----------------

If you would like to contribute code, it is strongly
recommended that you first discuss your aims with the ``sunraster``
community.  We strive to be an open and welcoming community for
developers of all experience levels. Discussing your ideas
before you start can give you new insights that will make your
development easier, lead to a better end product, and reduce the
chances of your work being regetfully rejected because of an issue you
weren't aware of, e.g. the functionality already exists elsewhere.
See :ref:`getting_help` to contact the ``sunraster`` community.

The development of ``sunraster`` is done using `git`_ version control
software and `GitHub`_,  a website that allows you to upload, update,
and share code repositories (repos).
If you are new to git or GitHub you can learn more from the following guides:

* `github guide`_
* `git guide`_

As a sunpy-affiliated package, ``sunraster`` is developed with the knowledge
and support of the SunPy development team and in accordance with the SunPy
development practices.
A comprehensive guide for contributing to SunPy can be found in the
`SunPy Developer's Guide`_ and has sections suitable for newcomers and seasoned developers.
To learn how to contribute code to ``sunraster`` see the `Contributing Code to SunPy`_
section of the guide and the references therein.
The principles outlined there are the same as ``sunraster`` except that
you will have have to replace ``sunpy`` (or ``astropy`` if reading the AstroPy
guide -- also recommended) with ``sunraster`` in the commands
and replace the url of the SunPy Github repo with that for the
`sunraster GitHub repository`_.
