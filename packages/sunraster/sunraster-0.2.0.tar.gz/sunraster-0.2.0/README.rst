``sunraster`` is an open-source Python library that provides the tools to read in and
analyze spectrogram data using the Python programming language.

Installation
============

An easy way to install ``sunraster`` is to do so with the anaconda distribution
using the conda-forge channel, with the following command at the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  conda install --channel conda-forge sunraster

Another equally easy way to install ``sunraster`` is with pip:

Developing
==========

If you want to develop ``sunraster`` you will need to install from GitHub.
We suggest you fork ``sunraster`` so you can work on it.
The best way to do this is to create a new python virtual environment
(conda/pipenv or others) and then install the git version of ``sunraster``:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/sunraster.git
    $ cd sunraster
    $ pip install -e .
