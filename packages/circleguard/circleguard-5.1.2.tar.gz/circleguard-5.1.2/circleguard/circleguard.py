class Circleguard:
    """
    Circleguard is the main entry point for using circlecore. In particular, we
    provide methods to calculate various statistics about
    :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Replay`\s:

    * :meth:`~.similarity` - the similarity between two replays.
    * :meth:`~.ur` - the unstable rate of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.snaps` - any unusual snaps in the cursor movement of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.frametime` - the average frametime of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.frametimes` - a list of the time between frames of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.hits` - the locations in a replay where a hitobject is hit.

    We also provide methods to interact with
    :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Loadable`\s:

    * :meth:`~.load` - loads a :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Loadable`.
    * :meth:`~.load_info` - loads the info of a
      :class:`~circleguard.loadables.ReplayContainer`.
    * :meth:`~.Map` - creates a new :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Map` and
      loads its info.
    * :meth:`~.User` - creates a new :class:`~circleguard.loadables.User` and
      loads its info.
    * :meth:`~.MapUser` - creates a new :class:`~circleguard.loadables.MapUser`
      and loads its info.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key: str
        A valid api key. Can be retrieved from https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/.
    db_path: str or :class:`os.PathLike`
        The path to the database file to read and write cached replays. If the
        path does not exist, a fresh database will be created there.
        If ``None``, no replays will be cached or loaded from cache.
    slider_dir: str or :class:`os.PathLike`
        The path to the directory used by :class:`slider.library.Library` to
        store beatmaps. If ``None``, a temporary directory will be created for
        :class:`slider.library.Library` and subsequently destroyed when this
        :class:`~Circleguard` object is garbage collected.
    loader: :class:`~circleguard.loader.Loader`
        This loader will be used instead of the base loader if passed.
        This must be the class itself, *not* an instantiation of it. It will be
        instantiated with two args - a key and a cacher.

        The similarity between ``replay1`` and ``replay2``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        replay1: :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Replay`
            The replay to compare against ``replay2``.
        replay2: :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Replay`
            The replay to compare against ``replay1``.
        method: {"similarity", "correlation"}
            What method to use to calculate the similarity between the replays.
            |br|
            ``similarity`` is (roughly speaking) the average distance
            between the two replays in pixels. A replay compared to itself (or
            an exact copy) has a similarity of 0. See
            :data:`~circleguard.Circleguard.SIM_LIMIT` for a suggested number
            where similarities below this number indicate a stolen replay.
            |br|
            ``correlation`` is a signal-processing metric which measures how
            similar two signals (or replays, in our case) are. Correlation also
            takes into account time shifts, so a replay which is a perfect copy
            of another replay but consistently lags 10 ms behind will still have
            a perfect correltion of ``1``. The higher correlation, the more
            correlated (or similar) the two replays are. See
            :data:`~circleguard.Circleguard.CORR_LIMIT` for a suggested number
            where correlations above this number indicate a stolen replay.
        num_chunks: int
            How many chunks to split the replay into when comparing. This
            parameter only has an affect if ``method`` is ``correlation``.
            Note that runtime increases linearly with the number of chunks.
        mods_unknown: {"best", "both"}
            What to do if one or both of ``replay1`` and ``replay2`` do not
            know what mods they were played with. In this case, the similarity
            will be computed twice, both with no modifications and with
            ``Mod.HR`` applied to ``replay1``.
            |br|
            If ``best`` is passed, the best (that is, lowest if ``method`` is
            ``similarity`` and highest if ``method`` is ``correlation``)
            similarity of these two calculations is returned.
            |br|
            If ``both`` is passed, a tuple with two floats is returned. The
            first element is the similarity with no modifications, and the
            second element is the similarity with ``Mod.HR`` applied to

        -------
        float
            If ``method`` is ``similarity``, this is the similarity of the two
            replays. If ``method`` is ``correlation``, this is the correlation
            between the two replays.
        (float, float)
            If ``mods_unknown`` is ``both``, a tuple with two floats
            is returned. The first element is the similarity with no
            modifications, and the second element is the similarity with
            ``Mod.HR`` applied to ``replay1``. See the documentation for the
            ``mods_unknown`` parameter for more information.

        Notes
        -----
        This function is provided as a convenience for when you want to create a
        ``Map`` and load its info immediately. A common occurrence in using
        ``Circleguard`` is to want to instantiate a ``Map`` and immediately
        iterate over it to operate on its replays. However, this ``Map`` must
        be info loaded before it can be iterated over, so this function does
        that info loading for you.

    db_path: str or :class:`os.PathLike`
        The path to the database file to read and write cached replays. If the
