    A Loadable that holds Loadables, which may be ``ReplayContainer``\s or

    Parameters
    ----------
    loadables: list[:class:`~.Loadable`]
        The loadables to hold.
    cache: bool
        Whether to cache the loadables once they are loaded. This will be
        overriden by a ``cache`` option set by a :class:`~Loadable` in
        ``loadables``. This only affects child loadables when they do not have
        a ``cache`` option set.

    Notes
    -----
    This class is intended for situations when you have a list of replays and
    replay containers, but no way to separate or distinguish them. If you want
    to get, say, all the replays out of that list (whether they come from
    replay subclasses already in the list, or the replays held by a replay
    container in the list), this loadable container class has the logic to do
    that for you:

    >>> lc = LoadableContainer(mixed_loadable_list)
    >>> replays = lc.all_replays()

    It can also be useful to info load the replay containers in the list,
    without first filtering the list to remove any replay subclasses:

    >>> cg.load_info(lc)
    >>> # all loadable containers in the list are now info loaded
    >>> cg.load(lc)
    >>> # all loadables in the list are now loaded

    You are very unlikely to want to subclass this class. If you want to add a
    new loadable that holds replays, subclass ``ReplayContainer``.
