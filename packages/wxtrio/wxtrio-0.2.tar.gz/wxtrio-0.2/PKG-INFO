Description: # wxtrio
        Run wx with trio in guest mode.
        
        Limitations of this approach:
         - The GUI hogs processing (and hence, trio tasks do not run) when the mouse is not moving while doing any of the following:
            - Resizing windows
            - Moving windows
            - Navigating menus
         - Trio is started in guest mode, so wxPython's main event loop must be started before trio.  As a result, all async tasks are cancelled when the wxPython application exits.
