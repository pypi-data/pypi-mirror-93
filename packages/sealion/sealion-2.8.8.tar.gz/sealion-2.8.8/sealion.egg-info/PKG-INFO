Description: # SeaLion
        
        SeaLion was designed to teach programmers the popular machine learning concepts of today in a way that gives both intution and ways of application. 
        We do this through documentation that explains the models, how they work, and how to use them with examples on familiar datasets like iris, breast cancer, MNIST, etc. 
        Through this library we newer students will learn common algorithms and those more experienced will appreciate the functionality.
