"""Republish OOPS reports from a DateDirRepo over AMQP.

Run the script::

  $ bin/datedir2amqp --host XX --username XX --password XX --vhost XX \
    --exchange XX --repo XX

Note that the repo should be the same path you are supplying to your
DateDirRepo in whatever process is creating OOPSes.

A common use for this setup is as a fallback: in your application report to
AMQP directly, with a DateDirRepo configured as fallback, then use datedir2amqp
to pickup and respool any OOPS reports that were generated while your AMQP
server is unavailable.

# values except releaselevel are integers; the release level is 'alpha',
