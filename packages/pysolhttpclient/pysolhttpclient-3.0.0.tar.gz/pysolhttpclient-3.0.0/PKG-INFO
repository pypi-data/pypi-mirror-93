        ============
        
        Welcome to pysol
        
        Copyright (C) 2013/2017 Laurent Labatut / Laurent Champagnac
        
        pysolhttpclient is a set an HTTP client Apis
        
        They are gevent based
        They support urllib3 and geventhttpclient implementations
        They support http and https
        They support http proxy (tested with squid)
        
        HttpResponse.headers is a dict, from string to string (direct header access) or from string to list (in case the same header is present several times in the http response)
        
        Source code
        ===============
        
        - We are pep8 compliant (as far as we can, with some exemptions)
        - We use a right margin of 360 characters (please don't talk me about 80 chars)
        - All unittest files must begin with `test_` or `Test`, should implement setUp and tearDown methods
        - All tests must adapt to any running directory
        - The whole project is backed by gevent (http://www.gevent.org/)
        - We use docstring (:return, :rtype, :param, :type etc..), they are mandatory
        - We use PyCharm "noinspection", feel free to use them
        
        Requirements
        ===============
        
        - Debian 10 or greater, x64, Python 3.7
