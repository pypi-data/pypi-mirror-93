# cmcrameri

This is a Python wrapper around Fabio Crameri's perceptually uniform colour maps

http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php

All credit for creating the colourmaps to Fabio. Any errors in the Python implementation of colourmaps are my own.

This version is based on Scientific Colourmaps Version 6.0.4 (06.01.2020)

### Install

With pip:

`pip install cmcrameri`

With conda:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install cmcrameri
```
### Usage example

```python
from cmcrameri import cm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(0, 100, 100)[None, :]  
plt.imshow(x, aspect='auto', cmap=cm.batlow) # or any of the other colourmaps made by Fabio Crameri
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
### Extra instructions
You can access all the core colourmaps from Fabio Crameri's list by `cm.<colormapname>`

You can use tab autocompletion on `cm` if your editor supports it

For a reversed colourmap, append `_r` to the colourmap name

Categorical colormaps have the suffix `S`

For an image of all the available colourmaps without leaving the comfort of your Python session
```python
from cmcrameri.cm import show_cmaps 
show_cmaps()
```
