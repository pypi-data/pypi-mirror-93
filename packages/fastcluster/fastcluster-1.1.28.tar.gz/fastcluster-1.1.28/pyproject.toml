[build-system]
# We specify older version of numpy for the build environment because
# numpy tries to maintain backwards compatibility but not forward
# compatibility. So, if a user tries to use an extension that was compiled
# along with an earlier version of numpy (say 1.12) than the user has on
# their current system, that will work (say 1.15). However, if the
# extension was compiled with a numpy 1.15 and the user has 1.12 on their
# system, the extension will not work.
#
# For each version of Python, we choose the earliest versions of numpy that
# has binary wheels for that Python version for window, mac, and linux.
# Otherwise building fastcluster would require compiling numpy which
# would make things much, much slower.
