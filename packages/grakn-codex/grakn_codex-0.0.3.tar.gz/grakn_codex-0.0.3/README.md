# Codex - Programmatic Knowledge Graph Framework

## What is Codex

Codex is a Python package that provides a simple, yet powerful API designed to make working with the [Grakn](https://grakn.ai/) knowledge graph intuitive. 

## Why develop Codex

Building, querying, and interrupting results from the Grakn knowledge graph requires expertise in learning the specific query language graql and learning how to use the verbose API. 
Codex abstracts away the mundane and tedious aspects of using knowledge graphs, so you can focus on organizing your data and getting answers. 

## Installing Codex

### Dependencies

The following are dependencies need to properly run Codex

* docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* python3.6+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/)


### Installing Codex

Codex is compatible with Python 3.6 or later. The simplest way to install Codex and its dependencies is by...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/banjtheman/grakn-codex.git 
cd grakn-codex
pip install grakn-codex
```

In addition to the python package, Codex leverages Grakn and the Redis docker images to store data.


### Quick Start

Here's how you can quickly use Codex

**Setup Database**
```bash
mkdir -p data
mkdir -p redis_data
docker-compose up -d
```

**Load and query**
```python
import logging
import pandas as pd
from codex import CodexKg 


#Load csv data
df = pd.read_csv("sample_data/tech_companies.csv")

#Make new codex object
codexkg = CodexKg()

#Create new keyspace
codexkg.create_db("tech_example")

#Load data into Grakn
codexkg.create_entity(df, "Company", entity_key="name")

# Find Company that has a name equal to Google
ans = codexkg.find(
        concept="Company",
        concept_attrs=["name"],
        concept_conds=["equals"],
        concept_values=["Google"],
)

#Display data as a DataFrame
logging.info(ans)

# {'Company':      name  budget
#				0  Google  999.99}
```
