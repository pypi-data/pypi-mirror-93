        Life, the Universe, and Everything
        ----------------------------------
        
        ``collective.cover`` is a package that allows the creation of elaborate covers
        for website homepages, especially for news portals, government sites and
        intranets that require more resources than a simple page or collection can
        offer. However, despite offering rich resources to build a cover,
        ``collective.cover`` also provides a very easy mechanism for managing its
        contents, built around a drag-and-drop interface.
        
        ``collective.cover`` is based on `Blocks <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.blocks>`_ and `Tiles <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.tiles>`_,
        like `Mosaic <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.mosaic>`_,
        the new layout solution for Plone.
        
        .. note::
            Starting from version 2.0b1 this package is compatible with Plone 5.1;
            nevertheless, there are some `known issues <https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22plone+5%22>`_.
        
        Demo
        ^^^^
        
        For impatient types, there is a demo installation of collective.cover on `Heroku <http://collective-cover.herokuapp.com>`_.
        It needs about 60 seconds to spin up and it will purge all changes after about an hour of non-usage.
        
        Use cases
        ^^^^^^^^^
        
        Suppose you are running The Planet, a news portal that has a bunch of editors
        focused on getting news on different topics, like Economy, Health or Sports.
        
        If you are the main publisher of the site, you may want to delegate the
        construction of the front page of the Economy section to the people working on
        that content area, but you might not want them messing around the Sports
        section as well.
        
        Also, suppose you have the final game of the World Cup and the match is going
        to be defined on penalties: you may want to prepare a couple of cover pages
        and publish the right one focused on the team that won in the end.
        
        These are the kind of issues we want to solve with this package; we are still
        far from it, but that is the idea.

        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following to it:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.cover
        
            [versions]
            ...
            collective.js.bootstrap = 2.3.1.1
            plone.app.blocks = 4.2.0
            plone.app.tiles = 3.1.0
            plone.tiles = 2.1
        
        If you want to use the relation field you must use the ``[relations]`` extra in your buildout configuration.
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.cover [relations]
        
        If you want to use a newer release of ``collective.js.bootstrap``, you will need to update ``plone.app.jquery``:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [versions]
            plone.app.jquery = 1.8.3
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.cover`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. note::
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
            in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        We use `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`_ to process static resources on this package.
        `webpack`_ processes SCSS and JS files, minifies the resulting CSS and JS, and optimizes all images.
        
        To contribute, you should start the instance in one shell and start webpack watcher on another with the following command:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ bin/watch-cover
        
        Then go to ``webpack/app`` folder and edit SCSS and JS files;
        `webpack`_ watcher will automatically create the final resources in the right place.
        
        There are also other commands added to handle more complex scenarios.
        
        The following command will set the buildout node installation in the system PATH,
        this way you can use `webpack`_ as described on their documentation.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ bin/env-cover
        
        The following command generates JS and CSS without the minify step (it can be used to check the code being generated in a human readable way).
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ bin/debug-cover
        
        The following command rebuilds static files and exit (insted of keep watching the changes):
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ bin/build-cover
        
        Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        In version 2.0b1 we removed a hard dependency on ``plone.app.relationfield``.
        You must use the ``[relations]`` extra in your buildout configuration as stated above,
        or your site will break with the following error:
        
        .. code-block:: pytb
        
            AttributeError: type object 'ICatalog' has no attribute '__iro__'
        
        Not entirely unlike
        -------------------
        
        Over the years there have been some packages designed to solve the problem of
        creating section covers in Plone. We have used and have taken ideas from the
        following:
        
        `CompositePack <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.CompositePack>`_
            Very old; the legacy code is so complex that is not maintainable anymore.
            It has (arguably) the best user interface of all. Layouts can not be
            created TTW. Viewlets are just page templates associated with content
            types; you can drag&drop viewlets around the layout. Publishers love it.
        
        `CMFContentPanels <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.CMFContentPanels>`_
            Code is very old, but still maintained (at least works in Plone 4). Allows
            to create complex layouts TTW and use any layout as a template. Easy to
            extend and edit (but is terrible to find a content to use). Needs a lot of
            memory to work and aggressive cache settings.
        
        `Collage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Collage>`_
            Allows the creation of layouts TTW but it has (arguably) the worst user
            interface of all. It is easily extended and there are several add-ons
            available that provide new functionality for it.
        
        `Home Page Editor of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies Site <https://colab.interlegis.leg.br/browser/publico/camara.home>`_
            Strongly based on `Collage`_, this package was presented at the `World Plone Day 2012 Brasilia <http://colab.interlegis.leg.br/wiki/WorldPloneDay>`_.
            It allows editing of home pages and the definition of permissions on blocks of content.
            Works under Plone 3 only.
        
        `collective.panels <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.panels>`_
            A new package that lets site editors add portlets to a set of new
            locations: above and below page contents, portal top and footer. The
            package comes with a number of flexible layouts that are used to position
            the portlets, and locations can be fixed to the nearest site object, to
            facilitate inheritance. In ``collective.cover`` (this package), we don't
            want to use portlets at all.

        - Fix purging of tile annotations when removing tiles from the cover layout.
          This solves exponential growth of cover objects when using versioning,
          leading to check in/check out (plone.app.iterate) timeouts on backends using proxy servers (fixes `#765 <https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/issues/765>`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Do not auto include package dependencies, but declare them explicitly.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.6b4 (2017-10-30)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Revert declaring ``cover_layout`` field in content type schema as ``readonly`` (fixes `#761 <https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/issues/761>`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.6b3 (2017-10-23)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Fix edit view of carousel tile when one carousel item has a unicode character in its title (fixes `#757 <https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/issues/757>`_).
          [fulv]
        
        - Explicitly declare ``cover_layout`` field in content type schema as ``readonly``;
          Robot Framework tests pass again with latest version of Plone 4.3 (fixes `#759 <https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/issues/759>`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.6b2 (2017-09-01)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Use correct ``image/x-icon`` MIME type for ICO file format (fixes `#750 <https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/issues/750>`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix IDatetimeWidget tile override if using plone.app.contenttypes >= 1.1.1:
          collective.z3cform.datetimewidget is merged into plone.formwidget.datetime,
          so the zcml must override the template from plone.formwidget.datetime.z3cform.interfaces.IDatetimeWidget
          as well. (closes `#745`_).
          [idgserpro]
        
        - Review tile refresh using custom event.
          [rodfersou]
        
        
        1.6b1 (2017-06-23)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Fix deprecation of adapters made in previous release, as they were incorrectly removed.
          Code removal will still happen in collective.cover v1.7.
          [idgserpro]
        
        - Use absolute URL for root in content chooser tree (fixes `#733 <https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/issues/733>`_).
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix content chooser clear button to update results (closes `#727`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Drop support for Plone 4.2.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix typo in basic tile template (``is_empty`` is not a property but a function).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.5b1 (2017-06-12)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. Warning::
            If you are upgrading plone.app.tiles note that latests versions of this package no longer depend on plone.app.drafts.
            You should explicitly add plone.app.drafts to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration to avoid issues.
            You can safely uninstall plone.app.drafts after that, if you are not using it.
        
            Adapters used to get the items inside a folder or the results of the query in a collection were deprecated.
            The following classes will be removed in collective.cover v1.7: ``ICoverUIDsProvider``, ``CollectionUIDsProvider``, ``FolderUIDsProvider`` and ``GenericUIDsProvider``.
        
        - Information stored on basic tiles populated with private content is no longer shown to users without proper permissions (fixes `#721`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Dropping a folder on a carousel tile no longer populates the tile with the items inside the folder;
          populating the carousel tile with the results of the query in a collection is still supported.
          [rodfersou, hvelarde]
        
        - Dropping a folder or a collection into a list tile previously resulted in the tile being populated with the items inside the folder or the results of the query in the collection,
          making impossible to have folders or collection as items of the list tile themselves (fixes `#713`_).
          [rodfersou, hvelarde]
        
        - Update recommended versions of Blocks dependencies to keep in sync with current Mosaic development.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix order of UUIDs of sorted function in ListTile's 'results' method.
          [idgserpro]
        
        - Review content chooser events to happen just at Compose tab (fixes `#710`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Do not assume all tile types have schemas.
          [alecm]
        
        - Do not declare the ``Cover`` class as an implementer of ``IDAVAware``;
          This makes absolutely no sense and is causing an error when doing a GenericSetup export (fixes `#396`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.4b1 (2016-12-14)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Fix ``@@updatetilecontent`` view to avoid rendering outdated data.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix ``TypeError`` when changing default image scale on basic tiles (fixes `#686`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Fixed adding a 'more' link in list tiles.
          Previously you could select an item to use as 'more' link,
          but it did not stick.  [maurits]
        
        - The ``replace_with_objects`` method was removed from the list tile;
          use ``replace_with_uuids`` instead.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - "Add Content" button is now shown also in Plone 5.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Avoid exceptions while using the content chooser in Plone 5.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Add helper function to get the human representation of a mime-type on Dexterity-based content types.
          This fixed an ``AttributeError`` that was causing an exception on Plone 5.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - We now get the types that use the view action in listings in Plone 5 also.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - ESI support was refactored; now all tiles inherit from ``ESIPersistentTile`` by default.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Add plone.protect when save layout (fixes `#651`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Use ``pat-modal`` instead of ``prepOverlay`` for Plone 5 (fixes `#641`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Enforce usage of plone.app.tiles >= 1.1.0 to avoid creation of zillions of empty blob files when using versioning (fixes `#532`_, huge HT @datakurre).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.3b1 (2016-09-12)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. Warning::
            A huge code refactoring was made as part of the removal of the dependency on five.grok.
            The following unused views were removed: ``AddCTWidget``, ``AddTileWidget``, ``SetWidgetMap``, ``UpdateWidget`` and ``RemoveTileWidget``.
            All Compose tab helper views use now ``cmf.ModifyPortalContent`` permission.
            All Layout tab helper views use now ``collective.cover.CanEditLayout`` permission.
            The ``BaseGrid`` class is now located in the ``collective.cover.grids`` module.
        
        - Update Traditional Chinese translation.
          [l34marr]
        
        - Remove dependency on five.grok (closes `#510`_).
          [l34marr, rodfersou]
        
        - Use the `X-Robots-Tag` header to avoid indexing of image scales on default view;
          this will reduce the number of 404 (Not Found) responses generated by crawlers visiting the site in search of volatile content.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Enforce usage of plone.api >= 1.4.11 to avoid `TypeError` while running upgrade step to profile 14.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.2b1 (2016-07-04)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - A new calendar tile was added.
          The tile dislays a calendar that highlights the events taking place on the current month,
          the same way as the standard calendar portlet does.
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Handle `AssertionError` on upgrade step to profile 13 to avoid failures when a cover object has duplicated tiles on it.
          Now, an error message will be logged and the object will be skipped;
          you must manually remove the duplicated tiles (closes #619).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.1b1 (2016-03-31)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. Warning::
            This release removes some packages from the list of dependencies.
            Be sure to read the whole changelog and apply the related changes to your buildout configuration while upgrading.
            Also, note that we have reorganized the static resources contained here;
            as some of them are not registered in Resource Registry tools, you could end with a broken layout if you don't clear your intermediate caches.
        
        - Enforce usage of plone.app.blocks 2.2.1 to avoid issues with tiles breaking the whole cover page.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Add option to select random items in collection tile (closes `#608`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Carousel tile now uses a relative ratio to set its height (fixes `#414`_).
          [terapyon, hvelarde]
        
        - Remove hard dependency on plone.app.referenceablebehavior as Archetypes is no longer the default framework in Plone 5.
          Under Plone < 5.0 you should now explicitly add it to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration to avoid issues while upgrading.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Link integrity was refactored to work on all tiles and under Plone 5;
          a hard dependency on Products.Archetypes was removed (fixes `#578`_).
          [hvelarde, rodfersou]
        
        - Do not use the calendar tool to discover Event-like objects as it was removed on Plone 5.
          Instead, try to guess if an object is an Event by using its catalog metadata.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Package is now also tested with plone.app.contenttypes installed;
          a few bugs related with API incompatibilities among Archetypes and Dexterity were fixed.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Remove Grok dependency for vocabularies.
          [l34marr]
        
        - You can now use a collection to populate a carousel tile;
          search results without a lead image will be bypassed (fixes `#574`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Shows message to user if an exception is thrown in a tile in AJAX calls. (closes `#581`_).
          [idgserpro]
        
        - Fix date format in collection tiles (closes `#584`_).
          [tcurvelo]
        
        - RichText tile no longer breaks with plone.app.widgets installed (closes `#543`_).
          [frapell, rodfersou]
        
        - Add missing dependency on collective.z3cform.datetimewidget.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Remove hard dependency on plone.app.stagingbehavior as that package is no longer needed in Plone 5.
          Under Plone < 5.0 you should now explicitly add it to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration to avoid issues while upgrading.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Implement drag and drop among tiles (closes `#487`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Clean up static files.
          [rodfersou]
