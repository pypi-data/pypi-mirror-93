This package is a simple Star Symbol Finder.
To use it in your script just import it and then (if you imported it as starsymbolfinder), type starsymbolfinder.get_symbol(date, month)
Replace date and month with the date and month you want to find.
You can also use starsymbolfinder.output_enter() to make yourself able to type the date and month in the output.
