ExplainX.ai is a fast, scalable and end-to-end Explainable AI framework for data scientists & machine learning engineers. 

With explainX, you can understand overall model behavior, get the reasoning behind model predictions, remove biases and create convincing explanations for your business stakeholders.

#### Why we need explainability & interpretibility?

Essential for:
1. Model debugging - Why did my model make a mistake? How can I improve the accuracy of the model?
2. Detecting fairness issues - Is my model biased? If yes, where?
3. Human-AI cooperation - How can I understand and trust the model's decisions?
4. Regulatory compliance - Does my model satisfy legal & regulatory requirements?
5. High-risk applications - Healthcare, Financial Services, FinTech, Judicial, Security etc,.

# Installation

Python 3.5+ | Linux, Mac, Windows (Install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) first to run on Windows.)

```sh
pip install explainx
```

## Installation on the cloud
If you are using AWS SageMaker of Jupyter Notebook deployed on the cloud, visit our documentation for step-by-step guide installing and running explainX. [Cloud Installation Instructions](https://docs.explainx.ai/getting-started/installation)


## Example Usage
After successfully installing explainX, open up your Python IDE of Jupyter Notebook and simply follow the code below to use it:

1. Import required module.

```python
from explainx import * 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

```

2. Load and split your dataset into x_data and y_data

```python
#Load Dataset: X_Data, Y_Data 
#X_Data = Pandas DataFrame
#Y_Data = Numpy Array or List

X_data,Y_data = explainx.dataset_heloc()
```

3. Split dataset into training & testing. 

``` python
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_data,Y_data, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)
```

4. Train your model.

```python
# Train a RandomForest Model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```

5. Pass your model and dataset into the explainX function:

```python
explainx.ai(X_test, Y_test, model, model_name="randomforest")
```

6. Click on the dashboard link to start exploring model behavior:

```python
App running on https://0.0.0.0:8080
```

**If you are running explainX on the cloud e.g., AWS Sagemaker?** **https://0.0.0.0:8080** will not work.
Please visit our documentation for installation instructions for the cloud: [Cloud Installation Instructions](https://docs.explainx.ai/getting-started/installation)

After installation is complete, just open your **terminal** and run the following command.
```jupyter
lt -h "https://serverless.social" -p [port number]
```
```jupyter
lt -h "https://serverless.social" -p 8080
```
