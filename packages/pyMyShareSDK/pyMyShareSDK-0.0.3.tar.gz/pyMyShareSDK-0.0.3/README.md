**Important!  
We do not have access to the API at this point, as the API itself is not yet launched.  
We will be working on and updatinging this repo as soon as the situation changes!**

We are making the MyShare API easy to use, through our MySDK.  
Let us deal with setting up the correct HTTP request, so you don't have to.

## Introduction

This library provides a pure Python interface for the MyShare API. MySDK supports all of the mentioned Python versions in the tag above.

Along with the initial API implementation, this library contains clever solutions to help you write even less code and easily combine multiple functions together.

> You will need a TOKEN from MyShare API in order for this library to function.

## Documentation

- Thake a look at our [Wiki pages](https://github.com/LeanderGangso/pyMyShareSDK/wiki/installation), here you will find all you need to start integrating MySDK into your project.

- Visit the [MyShare API](https://api.myshare.today) documentation, as each method is structured in the same way.  

> All our methods have the same name's as the API, but with **snake_casing** instead.
> E.g. updateJob = update_job
